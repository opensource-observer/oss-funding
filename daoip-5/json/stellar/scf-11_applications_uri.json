          "projectDescription": "Flora is a marketplace where users can access apps, integrations, transaction templates, and third-party Soroban Smart Contracts. Problem. There are a lot of practical web3 applications that people can use, but adoption could be much higher. One big hurdle for user adoption is access to services, steep learning curves, and complicated user experiences. We want to simplify the user experience and promote the use cases rather than the underlying technology.\n\nFlora makes it easier for users to transact and engage. We want to make it easy for our users to access a variety of curated services that helps them make use of the Stellar network. Flora gives users access to apps and services for specific use cases, focuses on business, and aims to allow business owners to assemble their value chain much more quickly. These apps include transactions, governance tools, voting modules, invoicing, payment services, and third-party services.\n\nFirst, we will focus on transactions and transaction templates. Users can set transaction parameters through intuitive wizards and with human-friendly language. Some templates will include legal guidance to help users attach documents as legal proof of their transactions and improve user comfort.\n\nTransaction templates can be described as UI components for Stellar for smart contracts, both Classic Stellar Smart Contracts and transactions and later for Soroban Smart Contracts. Our focus is on business owners and project creators that want to bring their traditional business closer to DeFi and web3.\n\nAll users will require a Stellar wallet to keep their assets safe and secure. We will seek a relationship with developers on Stellar for support and the development of more apps and integrations, support growth, and contribute to user adoption on the network.",

Moreover, Mexican companies lose up to +9-12% in revenue in cross-border payments and spend up to 30 hours or more a month on payment transactions, a time that would be best spent on strategy. These businesses also struggle with liquidity due to long settlement times, which push them to use credits or loans (more costs!) to keep their businesses running. On top of that, they spend effort and time redoing their invoices due to constant exchange rate fluctuations. We are creating features to help them do their job smoothly and pain-free.\n\n- Pay/receive directly with your local currency to merchants abroad in dollars or their local currency.\n- Automatic Payments | Schedule a one-time/recurrent date to pay one or multiple recipients; great for utility bills or salaries.\n- Mass Payments | Pay simultaneously to multiple users. Great for paying salaries!\n- Invoices | Sent invoices with smart adjustments to request payments (USD/local currency).\n- Accounting Imports | Download your transaction history to use it on your favorite accounting software.\n- Approvals | Invite collaborators and request approvals, for example, from accounting or you!\n\nWith Cashabroad, businesses of small and medium sizes like developing, design, marketing agencies, people that give courses online, consultants, real estate, and others will be able to open their frontiers.\n\n\u2692\ufe0f How it Works\n\nIn partnership with Wyre, we create a custodial wallet for each user and through Stellar Blockchain have compliant FIAT to crypto On/Off ramps.

FEE-FREE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS APP FOR OVERSEAS WORKERS. Our app allows overseas Filipino workers to transfer money without fixed fees at the best rates \u2013 saving an average 7.5% in fees on their hard-earned money. By removing fees, migrant workers are empowered with the opportunity to send what their families need, when they most need it. We built a network of +25,000 offramp locations nationwide \u2013 covering grocery chains, drugstores, hospitals, clinics, financial institutions, and cash networks, as well as utility suppliers including load and data providers, electricity, and water billers. RECEIVER WALLET: LAUNCHING THE FIRST TWO-SIDED REMITTANCE SERVICE. But remittances are naturally a two-way dynamic between migrant workers sending and those receiving funds \u2013 currently only served through remittance solutions on the send-side. +50 million people in the Philippines rely on remittances to make ends meet. More often than not, these people have been left behind by the financial system. The elsa.care Receiver App allows distant families to communicate and manage their family finances in a one-stop-shop. Through our wallet, Elsa revolutionizes the off-ramping experience for those whose lifeline depends on cross-border inflows. Allowing recipients to receive and track remittances, hold it in a local currency token \u2013 or USDC to hedge inflation \u2013 generate a yield on their balance, redeem through our nationwide network, and even earn rewards from our partners. A NEXT-GEN APP FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF THE UNDERBANKED. We aim to onboard non crypto-savvy users to benefit from Stellar by building non-custodial wallets for the underbanked Filipinos. This project will be the first step towards building an ecosystem of decentralized financial services that empowers 50% of the Philippine adult population to save, spend, and even access fair credit and loans. This wallet serves as the cornerstone of our vision: helping make payments more fair, and the financial system more accessible for +60m Filipinos!",

Ensure the wallet incorporates multiple login/signing popular options such as Albedo, Freighter, Rabet, Ledger, and Trezor. Provide Sep24 payment flows to ensure Stellar Anchor interoperability. Allow simple send and receive features within the wallet session time. Integrate Stellar swap functionality such as those features in the Albedo, LumenSwap, and Xbull wallet.\n\nThe Problem: To use the Stellar network, a user needs to create an account on Stellar, fund it via buying XLM to activate it. Then there are three main choices: Install a browser extension, use their private key directly on the website where they wish to spend their assets, or use a hard cold storage type wallet.\n\nNumerous people will find this off-putting due to the cost of a hard cold storage wallet. Simply because those people doing so, many find the concept of installing a browser extension can be annoying or even in some cases too complex. Most users would find this user experience to be too time-consuming and overly challenging. It\u2019s a time-consuming and laborious task that can lead to users like mum and dad or even Granny and Grandad excluding themselves from the Stellar experience.\n\nIn any case, \u201cEnter your password to complete this login\u201d is well understood by most. The only way to implement this login otherwise today is to use the private key directly on the website that generates the transaction, but users can\u2019t be certain of what the website will actually do with their private keys.\n\nStoring users' keys securely on their own devices. Enabling users to access their keys for login or signing with finger or face biometrics. Ensuring users don\u2019t even need to copy-paste keys, potentially losing them by accident. And utilizing The Simple Sign open-source widget for complete online protection.",

With Stellarcarbon, anyone with a Stellar account can do a voluntary carbon offset that is registered both on-chain and off-chain. We have been building the infrastructure needed to connect legacy carbon markets with the new digital economy taking place on public ledgers. Other companies building on Stellar will be able to integrate our backend service into their products and services, to give users easy access to carbon offsets. On top of this infrastructure, Stellarcarbon itself wants to develop and launch a retail shop for carbon offsetting aimed at individuals and businesses.\n\nA major problem that voluntary carbon markets have faced over the past decades is low trustworthiness, on both the supply and demand side. While several governance bodies have stepped up to increase the integrity of carbon markets, it is still possible for providers to offer carbon credits without any oversight. Stellarcarbon addresses this problem by only working with a subset of VCS and CCB certified offsets, and by individually vetting projects.\n\nCentralized registries are still essential, and we need to rely on them for the safeguards they provide. Unfortunately, they offer no way to intervene when an offset is used to make inaccurate claims about a company\u2019s sustainability, or is even used to cover up environmental or social damage caused elsewhere. Stellarcarbon will develop terms of purchase that, together with a clawback mechanism, will allow us to invalidate malicious offsets on-chain.\n\nStellar provides us with the payment rails to fund offsets, and with transparent accounts onto which we can lock a carbon offset. An offsetter can pay with any liquid asset in their account to receive CARBON, select a vetted offset project to fund, and receive CarbonSINK as on-chain proof of retirement. Their offset is recorded in the Verra Registry, and the offsetter receives an off-chain certificate directly from Verra.",

Consumers will not be required to pay monthly subscriptions to access streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify or sign up for any service, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords. Consumers only need a pre-funded compatible wallet on their PC or mobile phone and choose what they want to read, see, listen, or use. By further applying this technology, we will develop the concept of payment bandwidth, which will translate to some amount of money per minute or second. Cell phone carriers, for example, could opt to charge different payment bandwidths for 3G, 4G, or 5G pay-as-you-go download speeds.\n\nToday, 70% of Latin America's population remains unbanked or underbanked, and 58% of point-of-sales purchases are still made in cash. Consequently, over 400 million prepaid aggregate service subscribers in Latin America struggle with paying for utility services every month. Being excluded from the financial system and paying for recurring services is not only inconvenient and tiring; it is expensive. When handling prepaid customers, utility companies and merchants are subject to high fees, deductions, commissions from prepaid cards by vendors, and sometimes even interest. Paradoxically, these inefficiencies make the poor pay higher rates for services, making it expensive to be poor.\n\nBy building on Stellar, Paystreme will provide the fastest, most convenient, and most efficient way of paying for services. By using Stellar's Layer 2 payment channel, Starlight, we can process over 1 million payments per second per channel, making our platform highly scalable and efficient. Also, by partnering with MoneyGram and Stellar, we will be able to use hundreds of thousands of locations to onboard cash clients onto crypto. Unbanked consumers can use cash to pay for services at more competitive rates than before. Lastly, by integrating into Stellar's Anchor Platform, we will access traditional FIAT rails and allow banked users to easily top off their wallets.",

For more info see the \u201cOverview\u201d section.\n\nWhat problems do we solve?\n\nKata.Games deletes 3 problems simultaneously:\n\n1) How can one create games and share them online efficiently?\nWe provide creators with a toolbox and the access (via KataSDK) to a brand new infrastructure. It allows anyone to create, host, share his/her independent game. The key benefit here is simplicity of use.\n\n2) How do players connect with game creators in a fast and convenient way?\nWe\u2019ve built a proprietary technology capable of \u201cstreaming\u201d and running any kind of 2D game in the browser, along with its dedicated hosting solution for games.\n\n3) How to make cryptocurrencies widely adopted widely?\nWe build a product that will attract and retain a large number of users due to its features and its innovative design. Using the Stellar network adds benefits: for players the diversity of games will be greater (because the barrier to entry is lowered for creators) and players will learn real-world technologies/skills while using our system!\n\nKata.Games' Stellar integration\n\nUsing Stellar allows us to:\n\n- Provide a unified digital identity for the user. Such an identity can be used throughout many games, this is convenient. During registration, every new avatar gets associated with a pair: Stellar address, extra details\u2026 Once it\u2019s done the Stellar address contributes to authenticating a user. We use the Freighter wallet at Sign in and Sign up time, and integration of Albedo will be added.\n- Secure the ownership of virtual goods. If the user buys a very valuable item in a given game, we will store the ownership on the Blockchain via an NFT. An extra benefit is being able to use the SDEX for trading virtual goods minted by us. Also, we\u2019ve introduced special game entities called \u201cportals\u201d. Every portal is represented by an NFT-like token. Owning a portal implies that you can configure it to redirect to the game of your choice. In other words, you can own a part of our virtual world!\n- Enhance the freemium model, speed up microtransactions. Transactions done via our system will be faster and more inclusive compared to competitors. Paying one\u2019s premium status on Kata.Games will be done via cryptos. More specifically, we want to operate like a crypto exchange: fiat deposits will be possible (withdrawals too, but later in our company development) but fiat money will not be used at all when users are active within the system, only cryptos will.",

In a world where cashless payments are becoming the norm, retailers bear up to 3.5% transaction fees that go to Banks, card issuing Companies and Payment Service Providers. Cashless convenience comes at the cost of local businesses. With the boom of blockchain, more and more customers are hunger to use their digital assets to pay on and offline. But current payment solutions are not network agnostic and replicate the traditional fee-based model, coming again at retailers\u2019 cost.\n\nABOUT BRAVEPAY\n\nBravePay is a zero fees payment platform that makes cashless payments universally accessible for on and offline retailers. BravePay enables on and offline businesses to receive instant bank card or crypto payments, and safely store transaction value in USDC (Stellar). BravePay doesn't require any special hardware: it seamlessly works on any smartphone or can be integrated in any website in just a matter of minutes. BravePay also provides retailers with \"tech steroids\" to take their businesses to the next level: AI Powered age-verification, access controls, ERP, NFT tickets, crypto direct debit automation, crypto-payroll...\n\nBRAVEPAY & STELLAR\n\nUnleashing the power of Stellar to disrupt retail payments.

Bridging to one of the most popular Web3 ecosystems gives Stellar users more access to DeFi opportunities. Based on already tested infrastructure (XCLAIM and interBTC), Spacewalk is implemented as a Substrate (the blockchain framework on which Polkadot is built) pallet and allows any Substrate-based blockchain to implement a direct Stellar bridge.\n\nStellar Oracle\n\nA key component of the bridge is the Stellar oracle, which relays the state of the Stellar network to external services (like a bridge). The Stellar oracle is decentralized and by design at least as secure as the Stellar network itself. While this oracle is developed with Spacewalk in mind, it can be used by other bridge services. By giving this oracle to the Stellar community, we hope to see more bridges being built to connect Stellar with the broader DeFi/Web3 world.",

          "projectDescription": "A modern cloud LaTeX editor with a google docs alike UX and UI, and a built-in Stellar decentralised documents marketplace. The product I am presenting is sTeX, a cloud-based LaTeX editor featuring a modern user interface, as well as a fast and efficient user experience that aims to replicate Google Docs\u2019 one. At its core, the app will feature a decentralized marketplace for documents (including but not limited to sTeX\u2019s) which is built upon the multisig safety of Stellar turrets.\n\nLaTeX is a document preparation system that enables its users to write highly customizable and professional PDF documents. Rather than writing documents with formatted text, LaTeX lets you write documents in plain text, and uses markup tagging to define how the document looks like.\n\nFor example, both I and tdep#4794 use LaTeX almost on a daily basis for a variety of tasks: taking notes, product behavior design, writing whitepapers, technical writing, blogging, and working on financial instruments (for writing math).\n\nMost LaTeX editors aren\u2019t cloud-based and require you to install both the app and a TeX compiler as well, and the existing cloud-based LaTeX editors have room for improvement, especially in terms of user experience, interface, and sometimes speed (more on the competitors section in \u201cadditional information\u201c). That is why I have decided to start working with tdep#4794 to build a brand-new modern LaTeX editor inspired by Google Docs.\n\nThe sTeX app will implement a decentralized marketplace at its core. Users will be able to effortlessly bring sTeX\u2019s documents on-chain and have full control over them (sTeX\u2019s app won\u2019t have any signing power on your on-chain documents).\n\nOnce a document is on-chain (as a stellar account), we can officially call it a non-fungible-token (despite not being an actual stellar asset, tdep#4794 will discuss this NFT implementation later on this section). These NFTs can then be traded on a turrets-powered decentralized marketplace. The current progress in the marketplace as well as in sTeX\u2019s \u201cdocument detach\u201d API endpoints allow to: write a LaTeX document, create that document on-chain, place a sell offer through the marketplace to sell that document at a certain price, and place a buy offer through the marketplace to buy a document at its price.\n\nThanks to the design of the tokenized documents, they can be edited by the owner, meaning that interesting features like proofed document management can be achieved through the marketplace. For instance, you can issue an agreement contract you wrote to other two interested parties and set that the super-majority (2/3) consensus must be reached to edit the contract (for example three signers with a weight of 10 each and a medium threshold of 20).\n\nThe market is non-custodial and decentralized, based on stellar turrets. Turrets were initially called Turing Signing Server since what they actually do is leverage multisig and let serverless workers sign a \u201ccontract\u2019s\u201c transaction. This means that by using more than one turret which aren\u2019t owned by the same entity we can achieve a certain degree of decentralization. We have chosen Turrets over Soroban for a couple of reasons: since we want to keep the document-as-account design, turrets seem like our only option given the limited access of soroban contracts to stellar \u201cclassic\u201c data; we don\u2019t need the degree of decentralization that native contracts offer given the fairly simple nature of our \u201ccontract\u201d; it will probably be much cheaper to run the contract on Turrets rather than using a soroban contract (though that\u2019s TBD depending on how soroban\u2019s cost model works out); our contract is on its own concurrency-safe, thus it doesn\u2019t need such model as described here.\n\nOverall, by using Turrets we save time and resources since Stellar already provides all the features we need for this contract.\n\nLastly, we also mention a possibility for an in-app freelancing mechanism supported by the marketplace, but we won\u2019t implement for now since it would require high community participation in voting for disputes, which is currently out of scope of our app\u2019s simple and intuitive design.\n\nEditor Features: secure and tested authentication and authorization, real-time compiler (our editor will display changes in the pdf as you finish writing your sentences), basic features (create, edit, share, manage access), templates (in development), advanced auto-completion, vs-code alike editor, commenting (in development), multiple themes (in development).\n\nThese are the features that are currently present in our editor, but feel free to recommend any that you deem interesting or necessary which we haven\u2019t or aren\u2019t implementing.\n\nIn the first submission, sTeX\u2019s goal was to directly store document content on-chain. This approach had some advantages especially in delegating authorization to Stellar validators, and mostly by also allowing non-custodial users in our app. However, tests showed that the approach held important disadvantages in terms of speed and efficiency. That is why we opted to using native storage for sTeX\u2019s API. This does not mean that we don\u2019t use stellar anymore at our app\u2019s core, as a matter of fact, all our infrastructure is made of ed25519 keypairs that are ready to become stellar accounts once sTeX\u2019s users begin creating documents on chain or start interacting with the marketplace. When documents are on-chain, sTeX still enables to modify those documents re-using the code in sTeX\u2019s \u201cfirst version\u201c where every update corresponds to a stellar transaction. The only difference is that now users that are only interested in writing LaTeX documents in a fast and friendly environment can do so without suffering decreased speed for something they do not need, and those interested in editing their on-chain documents can do so in a completely non-custodial way by signing transactions as they update their documents.\n\nThe above only talks about the Stellar integration in the most \u201ctraditional\u201c part of our codebase (create, edit and share documents), the rest is completely reliant on both Horizon and Stellar (bridge to detach documents, bridge to reattach documents, the DeFi marketplace).\n\nYou can review part of our code here, but that\u2019s just the marketplace\u2019s prototype contract since we don\u2019t want to make our API public (maybe yet). What we focus on is balancing and intersecting our \u201ctraditional\u201c codebase with our stellar-based one, and making sure that every interaction with Horizon is non-custodial on the user\u2019s end.\n\nOn its own sTeX doesn\u2019t bind much with Stellar being a LaTeX cloud environment, but with the built-in marketplace users who have probably never interacted with Stellar can experience for the first time Stellar in terms of payments speed and ease of possibly making of their documents a source of income.\n\nsTeX\u2019s backend facilitates the process of onboarding on-chain users without storing secrets or adding our signers to the users\u2019 accounts, allowing them to start interacting on-chain on their own and not only through our service.",
