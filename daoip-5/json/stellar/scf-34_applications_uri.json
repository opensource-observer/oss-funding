          "projectDescription": "Integrate Logistech with the Beans App SDK to enable businesses in the tourism and hospitality industry to accept crypto payments Project:  \nLogistech is a trusted payment processor for cruises, hotels, hostels, and tour companies. By integrating Stellar blockchain technology, it will provide guests with a fast, secure, and cost-effective way to pay.  \n\nSubmission:  \nLogistech, integrated with the Beans Merchant SDK, allows our Merchants\u2019 Guests to pay transactions with Lumens XLM, USDC and other top cryptocurrencies at very low fees compared to traditional payment processors.  \n\nProducts & Services:  \nLogistech is a fully integrated, modular hospitality platform designed to optimize operations for hostels, cruises, resorts and hotels. Our suite of applications enables businesses to manage guests efficiently, process payments seamlessly, and enhance the overall customer experience.  \n\nOur ecosystem includes:\n\n-   Guest Management App \u2013 Streamlines check-ins, guest tracking, and account management.  \n    \n-   Tour Management App \u2013 Handles tour bookings, itineraries, and sales .  \n    \n-   Cashless Point of Sales (POS) \u2013 Allows guests to make purchases using NFC cards or wearables, eliminating cash handling and improving transaction efficiency.  \n    \n-   Website (Beta) \u2013 Offers direct bookings, guest account access, and operational integrations.  \n    \n\n##### How Logistech Works:\n\nGuests use NFC wristbands or cards to make purchases during their stay, which are then settled at check-out via traditional payment methods. While this system is already frictionless, the integration of Stellar through Beans Wallet will further reduce transaction fees and enhance accessibility for international guests.  \n\nBy leveraging Beans Merchant SDK, we aim to:  \n\n1.  Enable QR-based check-outs, allowing guests to settle their bills using Stellar while merchants receive USDC.\n    \n1.  Reduce high transaction fees typically associated with international payments.\n    \n1.  Maintain the familiar guest experience while introducing a lower-cost, crypto-powered alternative.",

Merchants can withdraw funds directly to their bank accounts or in cash from any MoneyGram location.\n\n  \n\nThis submission will expand GreepPay\u2019s ecosystem by leveraging Stellar\u2019s blockchain and its anchor network to provide fast, low-cost, and borderless payments, improving financial accessibility for African consumers and global merchants.\n\n  \n\n#### 1. Cross-Border Payments Using Stellar and Its Anchors\n\nGreepPay enables African consumers to pay international merchants in their local currencies, while merchants receive funds in stablecoins (USDC) or directly in their preferred fiat currency.\n\n-   Yellow Card facilitates on-ramping of African currencies into Stellar\u2019s network.\n    \n-   MyKobo and Circle provide USD and EUR off-ramping services, ensuring merchants receive fiat settlements directly into their bank accounts.\n    \n-   Stellar\u2019s blockchain enables instant, low-cost, and transparent transactions, eliminating currency conversion barriers for African businesses and consumers.\n    \n\n2. User and Merchant Accounts on Stellar\n\nGreepPay utilizes Stellar\u2019s blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable transactions. Each user and merchant will have a blockchain-powered account, enabling direct payments with low fees and high reliability, compared to traditional financial rails.\n\n#### 3. Greep Reward Token for Gamification\n\n#### To drive engagement, we will launch the Greep Reward Token on Stellar. This token rewards transactions and merchant adoption, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. Stellar\u2019s low-cost token infrastructure ensures efficient distribution and management.\n\n#### 4. POS System and QR Code Payments\n\n#### Merchants will use a soft POS app (Android/iOS) to accept QR code payments, with transactions settled on Stellar\u2019s blockchain. This provides fast, secure, and cost-effective payments, eliminating the need for expensive hardware-based POS systems.\n\n#### 5. Compliance via KYC/AML Verification\n\nGreepPay integrates third-party KYC/AML services while leveraging Stellar\u2019s transparent ledger to ensure regulatory compliance. This allows for secure, frictionless onboarding of merchants and users, reducing fraud risks while maintaining trust.",

          "projectDescription": "Delivers instant stablecoin remittances to unbanked communities in LATAM through Stellar Blockchain and self-service kiosks Product\n\nLoto Punto is a kiosk for payments and payouts. It works as a gateway for 12 thousand financial services in banking, utility bills, cell phone top ups and digital wallets. Our system is integrated with Digital Identity and Open Banking services using AI, automating physical payments with high standards of security and fraud prevention.\n\nHow Loto Punto works with Stellar\n\nLoto Punto kiosks enable easy and affordable self-service transactions in local currency within seconds, providing a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to pay, send and receive money. By integrating Stellar Blockchain with Loto Punto\u2019s micro- service-oriented architecture system, we'll offer a more convenient an inexpensive channel for cross border remittances. This is achieved by converting physical FIAT currency into stable cryptocurrency and vice versa, partnering with relevant Stellar Wallets that provide on-ramp and off-ramp services in each LATAM country. For this matter, we have already an alliance with \"Meru Wallet\", that is integrated with Moneygram.\n\nIn the scope of this current project, we'll leverage our existing capabilities, installed capacity and knowledge of cryptoassets transactions, to On-Ramp fiat to crypto in the Stellar network, enabling fund transfers to Stellar accounts of end users. This new functionality will allow end users (senders) to make cost-effective remittances by converting FIAT currency deposited at Loto Punto kiosks into crypto accounts on the Stellar Network. Recipients can redeem their stablecoin digitally or at chosen Stellar anchor physical locations.\n\nBenefits\n\nLoto Punto offers a streamlined approach to financial services. Our kiosks are installed totally free in various points of sale with loyal customers such as convenient stores, drugstores and gas stations. Unlike traditional payment networks that rely on human agents, Loto Punto operates as an automated version, resulting in 50% lower operating costs. By eliminating the need for human sales agents and fixed space leasing costs,Loto Punto efficiently serves up to 40 locations with just one employee. This not only relieves point-of-sale staff from cash management operations and customer service but also provides a clear cost advantage over competitors that require a human interface for end-user transactions\n\nIn aggregate, by integrating Stellar and its Anchors, Loto Punto will serve as a convenient one-stop shop for unbanked users in LATAM.",

          "projectName": "Decentralized Multi-Cloud Storage - Flashback",
          "createdAt": "2025-02-09T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "The first multi-cloud platform, enabling Web3 and AI companies to manage and diversify their data storage across both centralized and decentralized cloud providers. We make it cheaper, simpler, and more flexible to store data. Web3 and AI demand for storage is rising, yet centralized cloud storage solutions dominate the market, driving up costs in a fragmented market. DePIN solutions like Filecoin and Arweave fall short, serving primarily archival needs with slow performance and limited incentives for storage providers. This forces businesses to rely on centralized providers due to the lack of seamless integration for decentralized storage.\n\nFlashback is the first agentic AI cloud diversification platform, enabling companies to diversify data across both centralized and decentralized cloud storage providers. It offers services such as credential account management, API orchestration, multi-cloud accessibility (AWS, GCP, Filecoin, StorJ), migration and interoperability, and AI-driven cost optimization and resource allocation.\n\nOne key layer of the platform is Flashback's own storage infrastructure network (DePIN), designed for Web3 businesses needing enhanced privacy, governance, and fast data retrieval. Built jointly with the Stellar Development Foundation, we have built a prototype leveraging Soroban smart contracts for service-level agreements (SLAs) and quality-of-service (QoS) evaluation. This prototype has shown reliable performances and has been approved by the SDF.\n\nWith support from the Stellar Community Fund, we aim to advance R&D on Stellar to develop a decentralized multi-cloud platform that integrates Flashback's DePIN and additional storage providers by developing the following features:\n\nFeature 1: Storage Provision Management\n\nFlashback connects storage infrastructure providers with equipment or cloud storage capacities with the platform's consumers (users and services).  \nIn this first feature, storage infrastructure providers can register and manage storage capacities across geographical regions, design SLAs, and monetize their infrastructure designed by the function of the smart contract and the platform. Providers from multiple cloud providers (centralized and decentralized) can register, add storage units with specific capacity, and manage their status (e.g. Available, Maintenance, Decommissioning). Stellar's built-in account and transaction systems ensure secure provider registration and operation tracking.\n\nFeature 2: User Allocation\n\nUsers who are developers of services using the platform can allocate and manage their storage usage in their reservation space. The platform will gather information from the smart contracts, such as costs and Quality of Services of the storage infrastructure providers, the tracking of their reservation consumption, and the history. In the long term, the consumers will incentivize the storage infrastructure providers for high performance and be able to migrate easily the data and its processes across the different cloud protocols.\n\nFeature 3: Unit Storage States\n\nThe provision from the storage infrastructure providers is segmented into unit storage. Unit storage can be reserved by one or multiple consumers. This feature of the smart contract abstracted by the platform allows storage to be tracked as unit states, including different states such as available, reserved, in-use, maintenance, and decommissioning to guarantee the storage infrastructure provider controls its operation and quality-of-services.\n\nFeature 4: Metric System\n\nThe metric system is crucial for monitoring the performances of consumers and storage infrastructure providers. Flashback must ensure the drawbacks of existing DePin technologies, which are too slow, can be solved with the network of storage infrastructure providers in Flashback. The metric system encoded in the smart contract and abstracted by the Flashback platform will collect real-time tracking of capacity, usage, and performance metrics of the storage infrastructure providers, but also consumers to drive fast data retrieval for instance.\n\nFeature 5: Security and Ownership Module\n\nFlashback is a platform that must fit with the compliance rules in different countries. We implement strict validation, caller authentication, and owner-specific operations. We leverage Stellar\u2019s robust authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and enforce contract rules to strengthen security and trust in decentralized storage management.\n\nFeature 6: Frontend Libraries/APIs\n\nA good service application can not exist without a good user interface. Flashback offers modular tools to interface with popular Stellar wallets and the Soroban smart contract, enabling developers to integrate Stellar blockchain interactions seamlessly into their applications. Simply, this feature enables the development for third-party applications, expands Stellar\u2019s ecosystem reach, and enhances accessibility for developers building on the platform.\n\nFeature 7: Engine Room Dashboard\n\nConsumers and storage infrastructure providers can track their performance with a dashboard for statistics visualization and interaction emulation for providers and consumers on the testnet. We integrate with Stellar\u2019s testnet to simulate blockchain interactions and provide real-time metrics for data and transaction visualization. We enable operational insights and testing capabilities for developers and stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions and a smoother transition to mainnet deployment.\n\nBy developing these features, we want to guarantee the Flashback\u2019s DePIN service will empower businesses to have a comfortable and user-friendly granularity of decentralized storage. Leveraging Stellar\u2019s robust smart contracts and authentication mechanisms, this service guarantees secure, compliant, and scalable operations for the modern Web3 ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to unlock unprecedented control and flexibility for developers, enabling them to drive innovation and achieve a competitive edge in a fragmented cloud market. We want to make Stellar technologies the backbone of our platform to bring more decentralization in the Cloud uses.",

          "projectDescription": "This proposal seeks to integrate the Stellar ecosystem with Range\u2019s Cross-Chain Explorer and Range Trail, our cross-chain, cross-ecosystem, real-time forensic intelligence platform.  The goal is to provide Stellar teams with new analytical and intelligence tools and improve the onboarding UX for new end users. #1: Cross-Chain Explorer Integration (including Range API)\n\nRange\u2019s Cross-Chain Explorer will incorporate Stellar and data from Allbridge, Axelar, and Tricorn (and other upcoming interoperability protocols), providing real-time, comprehensive asset tracking across the Stellar ecosystem. This will allow users, developers, and product teams to filter and monitor inflows, outflows, bridge routes, and counterparty chains, offering deeper transparency into cross-chain asset movement.\n\nWith this integration, users will gain instant visibility into cross-chain liquidity flows, helping them track bridged assets, analyze cross-chain transactions, and detect anomalies or unusual activity. Builders and product teams can evaluate user behavior trends, optimize liquidity strategies, and respond to shifting market conditions more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, all data from this integration will be accessible via the Range API, enabling developers to build custom dashboards, risk monitoring tools, and analytics solutions tailored to their needs. This ensures that projects in the Stellar ecosystem can seamlessly integrate cross-chain intelligence into their applications, improving decision-making and security across the network.\n\nLearn more about the benefits of the Cross-Chain Explorer and how developers can leverage this data for advanced tracking, compliance, and asset security.\n\n#2: Stellar Bridge Explorer\n\nRange will develop a dedicated public Stellar Bridge Explorer to provide a real-time view of asset transfers to and from Stellar over Allbridge, Axelar, and Tricorn (and other upcoming interoperability protocols).\u00a0\n\nWhile the Cross-Chain Explorer integration above will display Stellar-related transactions in our full explorer for every ecosystem, allowing for cross-ecosystem awareness, this bridge explorer will be specific to Stellar only. It will include relevant cross-chain analytics such as inflows and outflows, key addresses, and volume metrics. See https://ibc.range.org/ibc/flows for reference.\n\nThe Stellar Bridge Explorer (to be hosted at stellar.range.org) will be similar to usdc.range.org, which tracks USDC transfers across Circle\u2019s CCTP, relied on by the team at dYdX, Circle and others for their day-to-day operations.\n\n#3: Advanced Trail Intelligence for Stellar\n\nWe will integrate Stellar into Range\u2019s Trail platform - our leading cross-chain risk, intelligence, and investigation tool. Our platform was instrumental in multiple hack investigations this past year, supporting companies such as Circle, Solana Foundation, and Neutron.\n\nRange Trail will track Stellar wallets\u2019 transaction flows across chains and ecosystems. It will enable transaction flow analysis, user profiling, and cross-chain activity tracking. Teams can visualize asset movements through interactive graphs and address cluster views, making it easier to analyze user behavior, detect suspicious activity, and identify high-risk counterparties This integration streamlines risk management and compliance processes, empowering teams to monitor assets and transactions across ecosystems.\n\nIn the event of a security incident, Range Trail will enable detailed forensic investigations, tracking stolen or compromised assets in real-time across multiple ecosystems. This capability will help teams pinpoint where funds have been moved and how they are being distributed and provide critical intelligence for recovery efforts.\n\nIntegrating Stellar into Range Trail empowers ecosystem teams, security researchers, and compliance officers with a powerful toolset for risk management, asset monitoring, and real-time blockchain forensics.\n\n#4: 6 months of Comprehensive Post Delivery ServiceAdvanced\n\nOnce we have completed the development and launch of the 3 products mentioned above, as part of this proposal, we will deliver six months of our comprehensive Post Delivery Service, which includes:\u00a0\n\n-   Maintenance to ensure compatibility with chain upgrades.\n    \n-   Updates to our parsers and processing to accommodate new types of onchain transactions and feature developments.\n    \n-   Additions or tweaks to the analytics and dashboards we produce to better align with common queries by ecosystem partners.\n    \n-   Exposing any such new metrics to all our API endpoints used by teams in Stellar.\n    \n-   Add new cross-ecosystem interoperability protocols as they onboard Stellar to their protocols.",

          "projectDescription": "NebulaVRF provides developers with a fully on-chain VRF for Soroban, ensuring secure, verifiable randomness without external oracles. NebulaVRF is a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for Soroban, providing secure, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable randomness for decentralized applications. It eliminates reliance on centralized randomness sources, ensuring tamper-proof and trustless randomness.\n\nEnsuring pure randomness is critical in decentralized systems because predictable randomness leads to manipulation and exploits. A well-known issue is the last-mover attack (vector bias), where the final participant in a randomness-based event\u2014such as a lottery or validator selection\u2014can delay or withhold their commitment until they see a favorable outcome. This exploit allows malicious actors to influence supposedly fair processes by selectively participating only when the randomness favors them. Without a cryptographic guarantee, many existing blockchain randomness implementations remain vulnerable to such attacks, making them unsuitable for high-stakes applications like DeFi, governance, gaming, and secure voting.\n\nOur current (tentative) approach being the VRF is, the VRF function generates randomness by taking a seed (optional, BytesN) for user-provided entropy, block metadata (BytesN) including block hash and timestamp for unpredictability, and a public identifier (String) like a user address or contract call ID to differentiate requests. The function outputs a 32-byte cryptographically generated random value along with a 64-byte verifiable proof, ensuring the randomness is tamper-proof and can be validated later.\n\nDevelopers can integrate NebulaVRF in three ways:\n\n1.  On-Chain Soroban Contract \u2013 For fully trustless and verifiable randomness, ideal for DeFi, DAO governance, and NFT trait assignment.\n    \n1.  Fast API Endpoint \u2013 For low-latency randomness, useful in gaming, real-time lotteries, and airdrops, with optional on-chain proof verification.\n    \n1.  Rust-Based SDK (Cargo Package) \u2013 For backend applications needing secure randomness without blockchain overhead, such as AI models, or Web3 marketplaces.\n    \n\nUse Cases\n\n-   Gaming & Lotteries \u2013 Fair dice rolls, loot box rewards, randomized game mechanics.\n    \n-   NFTs & Metaverse \u2013 Randomized trait distribution, rarity assignment.\n    \n-   DeFi & Airdrops \u2013 Random token distributions, fair reward allocation.\n    \n-   DAO Governance \u2013 Unbiased committee selection, randomized voting mechanics.",
