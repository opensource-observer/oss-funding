          "createdAt": "2025-01-05T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "Stride is planning to build a fitness ecosystem which motivates and rewards the average person to build healthy habits and on the other hand solves everyday problems for fitness fanatics that want to elevate their fitness journey. A fitness ecosystem for everyone everywhere, making a change stride by stride. What is Stride?\n\nStride currently consists of 2 applications forming a fitness ecosystem, the idea is to reach as many people and effectively make a difference in as many peoples lives as possible no matter how small that change may be. To do that we decided to move forward with a dual application approach making it more accessible to anyone and everyone. So let\u2019s jump into both of our applications and what their purposes are:  \n\nStride Native App (Also considered the Pro app)\n\n-   Available on both GooglePlay and Apple App Store\n    \n-   Currently a MVP Beta built to allow users to earn $STRIDE airdrop points beginning there fitness journey as well as socialise.\n    \n\nWhat do we intend to build it into?\n\n-   A fitness application that will be a better solution to fitness enthusiasts than current traditional apps like Strava.\n    \n-   Consisting of features such as: Fitness tracking, advanced analytics, AI Fitness plans, PVP Racing, Hardware integrations, and a dynamic reward system, rewarding users for there efforts in ways that traditional apps simply don\u2019t.  \n    \n\nStride Lite Mini App (Our Lite Version)\n\n-   Available currently on Telegram\n    \n-   Coming soon to LINE Messenger App (We have been accepted to have early access to LINE\u2019s SDK for there soon too launch Mini App store, allowing us to be of the first applications to launch to 250 million LINE Messenger users!)\n    \n-   Currently a Beta built to allow users to walk to earn in game currency and spend this in game currency to enter cash raffles.\n    \n-   The idea is to keep the application simple, fun and very rewarding, making it attractive enough to those who might not be interested in fitness but convincing them to partake and with time maybe even upgrade to Stride Pro and take there fitness journey to the next level!\n    \n-   Launching Stride Lite on Fitness apps has allowed us to tap into a completely new market for the fitness applications which non of our competitors have and thus allowing us to already reach hundreds of thousands of users in just a couple months while in beta stage!  \n    \n\nPlease refer to this google doc for some visuals - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-REUO-zYc_Hn4BgyqvNT9HQc9TX20eSd7DbMZUjoME/edit?usp=sharing  \n\nStride integrates Stellar\u2019s tech to enhance user engagement and ensure transparency in its fitness ecosystem. Key features include:\n\nSoulbound Badges (Metadata for Achievements):  \n\nHow Stellar is used: Soulbound NFTs are created on Stellar's Soroban contracts to track user achievements and fitness milestones on-chain. Impact: Provides an immutable and transparent way for users to showcase their fitness progress, increasing motivation and long-term engagement.  \n\nPVP Challenges and Leaderboards:\n\nHow Stellar is used: Soroban smart contracts manage real-time tracking, ranking, and fair reward distribution based on leaderboard performance. Impact: Encourages competition and gamification, boosting user activity and retention.  \n\nRaffles for Token Rewards:\n\nHow Stellar is used: Stellar stores a secure, on-chain record of raffle wins and ensures transparent reward distribution. Impact: Builds trust in the fairness of reward mechanisms while adding an element of fun for users.  \n\nSoftcoin Claims via Mini apps (e.g., Telegram, Line):\n\nHow Stellar is used: Fitness activity data and achievements are recorded on-chain to ensure transparency and reliability. Impact: Simplifies the backend process and enhances trust, ensuring scalability and user satisfaction.\n\nThese features collectively create a robust fitness ecosystem that leverages Stellar\u2019s capabilities to deliver value, fairness, and transparency to its users.",

          "createdAt": "2025-01-05T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "SOO is a decentralized arbitration system for resolving on-chain disputes. It serves as an oracle for projects like prediction markets, insurance protocols, derivatives, and cross-chain bridges, providing data ranging from cryptocurrency prices to sports and political events. Stellar soroban contracts are currently being used for onChain contract development. I have done some initial work in this github repo(https://github.com/stackman27/soroban-opt-oracle) which i plan on expanding.\n\n-   OnChain Optimistic Oracle (OOO) contract\n    \n    -   The OOO is used to assert truths about the world which are verified using an optimistic escalation game.\n        \n    -   Core idea: an asserter makes a statement about a truth, calling \"assertTruth\". If this statement is not challenged, it is taken as the state of the world. If challenged, it is arbitrated using the Data verification engine or if configured, an escalation manager. Escalation managers enable integrations to define their own security properties and tradeoffs, enabling the notion of \"sovereign security\".\n        \n-   OnChain Voting Oracle contract\n    \n    -   Since all transactions are public we have to use extra tricks to keep some things temporarily hidden. Let\u2019s say we need input like an answer to a quiz or a move in a game from a group of players. We don\u2019t want these players to be able to just watch the blockchain for their competitors\u2019 answers. What we\u2019ll do is have everyone hash their answer and submit that first (the commit). Next, everyone will submit their real answer (the reveal) and we can prove on-chain that it hashes to the committed value. This interaction is handled by the Voting Oracle contract in soroban\n        \n-   OnChain Staking Contract\n    \n    -   Staking contract enabling XLM to be locked up by stakers to earn a pro rata share of a fixed emission rate. This contract also handles the staking, unstaking and reward retrieval logic. There won't be any new XLM token generated, but the yield will be generated based on the asserter/disputer lost staked. Tentative staking interface below;\n        \n            #[derive(Debug)]\n            pub struct VoterStake {\n                stake: u128,                           // XLM staked by the staker.\n                pending_unstake: u128,                 // XLM in unstake cooldown period, waiting to be unstaked.\n                pending_stakes: HashMap<u32, u128>,    // If a voter stakes during an active reveal, stake is pending.\n                rewardspaidper_token: u128,          // Internal tracker used in the calculation of pro-rata share of rewards.\n                outstanding_rewards: u128,             // Accumulated rewards that have not yet been claimed.\n                unapplied_slash: i128,                 // Used to track unapplied slashing in the case of bisected rounds.\n                nextindexto_process: u64,            // The next request index that a staker is susceptible to be slashed on.\n                unstake_time: u64,                     // Time that a staker can unstake. Used to determine if cooldown has passed.\n                delegate: Option<String>,              // Address a staker has delegated to. The delegate can commit/reveal/claimRestake rewards.\n            }\n        \n    \n-   OnChain Reward Distribution contract\n    \n    -   Reward Distribution is a sub contract that Staking Contract inherits. Rewards can either be distributed per epoch or based on the end of challenge period. The unstaking of reward will have to go through a cooldown period\n        \n\n-   Export a pluggable interface for other Soroban contracts to use it easily\n    \n    -   Build necessary adaptars for the oracle contract interface to be easily pluggable in other projects\n        \n    -   The adapters can be universally used or be changed subject to a specific project need\n        \n\n-   OffChain Data Verification Engine (DVE)\n    \n    -   This is an offChain component which will be written in Rust to read/write to Stellar blockchain\n        \n    -   DVE Purpose: Resolves disputes in the Soroban optimistic oracle by verifying disputed data.\n        \n    -   Dispute Process: Ex: A price request is submitted to the DVE, triggering a vote among SOO stakers.\n        \n    -   Voting Period: Voting lasts x hrs\n        \n    -   Voting Criteria: SOO stakers use off-chain price feeds to guide their votes.\n        \n    -   Final Price: The DVE aggregates votes to determine the final asset price for the given timestamp.",

According to Mckinsey 2023 report, Africa will be home to the world\u2019s largest working-age population by 2040. Africa is currently the fastest growing talent market for remote work.\u00a0 But the problem is, remote workers struggle to access their income from employers abroad. They experience salary delays of up to 2 weeks, high withdrawal charges of up to 15% and they are constantly being short-changed by the local currency devaluation.\n\nWe built CodeLn Pay to solve this problem. CodeLn Pay is a crypto cross-border payment platform that allows African-based remote workers to get paid the same day, at an affordable charge of 1% and giving them the option to receive salaries in stable coins. They are able to seamlessly invoice employers, receive payment and save stable coins in their digital wallet. We have most of our users in Nigeria and Ghana and we are expanding to Kenya where we have gotten interest from users in that market. We are helping our users to overcome the challenges of cross-border payments that are especially unique to Africa and delivering a fast, secure, and cost-effective payment channels on chain.\n\nOur current platform is a Web App on SEP 24, this award will be used to build our mobile app and integrate SEP 31 on Stellar. We have gathered feedback from our users from which we will upgrading our product.\n\nHere are the feature breakdown below:\n\n1.

We're asking for support to launch Stellarcarbon this coming summer. There are two big work packages we're going to build in parallel:\n\nThe first is to develop a carbon sinking smart contract to enable other Soroban developers to automate compensating for CO\u2082 emissions through their own contracts, by sending financial support to verified ecosystem restoration projects. We also need to add support for Soroban in our backend so that there is no functional difference between sinking carbon through classic Stellar and through smart contracts. This will introduce the flexibility we need to appeal to builders who are increasingly using Soroban in their products.\n\n  \nThe second package is to finalize the development of our dApp where individuals and small businesses can sink carbon. We have a list of UX issues to improve, and want to do a second round of usability testing to end up with a product that people love to use. This includes communicating clearly how we have a positive impact on climate and biodiversity, because most of our customers have no prior experience with the voluntary carbon market.",
