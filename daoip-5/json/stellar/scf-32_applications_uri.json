Summary of what we have built & learned\n\nIn our Q4 2023 submission we built our MVP and tested demand with one cash in option as well as USDC on Stellar and Bitcoin payments; this validated interest on the product, and showed we could improve easiness.\n\nIn our July 2024 submission we added cards and three more countries for cash in, and saw usage improve importantly. We also migrated from a marketplace format to an online store for merchants, and that brought us more than 200% increase in sales.\n\nSee our growth chart for signups and transactions here: https://imgur.com/a/jh9WBd6\n\nTHIS SUBMISSION WORKPLAN:\n\nIncrease usage 3-fold and volume 5-fold by adding local payments, which will open doors to greatly grow USDC exchange via p2p\n\n1.  Add local cash in method in Venezuela: Pago M\u00f3vil\n    \n    We currently only accept payments from abroad, but after doing a pilot in one location, we realized local payments are highly desired by users and estimate that we will increase our transaction count at least 3x! This will enable us to serve 100% of their clients and not just the 10% who actually are using it now from international purchases.\u00a0\n    \n1.  Work with our legal partners in order complete the set up of our legal entities in Venezuela and finetune Mexico in order have a frictionless connection to banking systems\u00a0\n    \n    Set up an entity that is connected to the banking system and can allow us to launch our pago m\u00f3vil collection scheme in Venezuela, and submit additional documentation to comply with local requirements in Mexico.\n    \n1.  Build exchange module base for Venezuelan fiat-USDC exchange\n    \n    After we are able to receive local fiat, we will exchange this into USDC in order to protect from inflation. In order to do this we will build and connect a rate information tool that will enable to know the exchange rate in an inflation economy in order to get accurate data for every time money is collected and exchanged to USDC via p2p systems and the official rate shared by central bank.",

          "createdAt": "2024-11-24T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "SocketFi is a smart wallet app built on Soroban, providing seamless Web3 access via social media sign-ins, enabling millions of social media users to connect with dApps and Web3 projects effortlessly. SocketFi is a smart wallet dApp built on Soroban and the Stellar ecosystem, designed to seamlessly connect millions of social media users to Web3. It provides a non-custodial alternative to traditional wallets by enabling smart wallet creation via social media sign-ins, simplifying blockchain adoption for everyday users.\n\nWith SocketFi, interacting with Web3 dApps and blockchain tools becomes easy. Users will be able to seamlessly connect to Web3 using their preferred social sign-ins, significantly reducing the friction of onboarding millions of everyday social media users who find Web3 complex.\n\nAddressing Feedback from SCF31 Submission\n---------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing feedback from our SCF31 submission, the SocketFi team has implemented several improvements and changes:\n\nReview of Project Budget and Scope\n\nTo address concerns regarding the project\u2019s high budget and broad scope, we have adopted a streamlined approach to enhance focus and cost efficiency:\n\n-   Clarified Objectives: SocketFi\u2019s objectives were refined, prioritizing core goals and functionalities. Features have been categorized into essential, optional, and future enhancements. This allows us to focus on delivering critical functionalities first while deferring less urgent elements to later phases, simplifying development without compromising quality.\n    \n-   Optimized Budget: The budget was reassessed, itemizing all expenses and identifying high-cost areas. Cost-saving measures were adopted, including the use of open-source tools, existing frameworks, and outsourcing specific tasks.\n    \n-   Structured Development Process: A detailed roadmap, with clear deliverables, deadlines, and milestones, now structures the project, enabling efficient progress tracking.\n    \n\nThese measures have successfully refined the project scope, optimized the budget, and established a focused, iterative development process, positioning the project for success.\n\nSocketFi SDK and Enhanced User Experience\n\nIn response to feedback regarding the success dependency on the SocketFi dApp portal UI, we have expanded SocketFi into a service. With the development of the SocketFi SDK, a toolkit that allows Stellar-based projects to integrate the SocketFi wallet as a login option, users will be able to seamlessly connect to dApps through social login within the dApp's UI, significantly reducing reliance on the SocketFi portal for success.\n\nAdditionally, we have prioritized creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface, ensuring an exceptional user experience with a focus on accessibility and ease of use.\n\nTo bolster user acquisition, we have implemented targeted strategies, including:\n\n-   Partnerships within the Stellar ecosystem.\n    \n-   An incentivized community participation approach.\n    \n-   Engaging marketing campaigns.\n    \n\nThese efforts will strengthen our user base and drive widespread adoption.\n\nAmbitious \"Super App\" Vision with a Phased Rollout\n\nWhile SocketFi is still in the development phase, positioning it as a \"super app\" is an ambitious goal. To achieve this, we have adopted a phased rollout strategy. Initially, we are focusing on core functionalities, including the SDK that allows dApps to independently integrate the SocketFi wallet. Over time, we will expand to include broader features, ultimately enabling users to access hundreds of dApps built on Soroban and Stellar from a unified platform.\n\nTechnical Clarification: Sending Funds Using Social Media Usernames\n\nIn the current version, users can send funds from accounts created with Twitter sign-in. However, they currently need to manually enter the recipient's wallet address. Future updates will enable fund transfers using usernames.\n\nOur implementation utilizes an on-chain mapping system within the smart wallet that associates Twitter usernames (and other social platform identifiers) with Soroban smart contract addresses (smart accounts). This system ensures that when a user enters a recipient's Twitter handle (and other supported platform identifiers), it is securely mapped to the corresponding wallet address.\n\nThe mapping operates by storing username-address pairs in the main (controller) smart contract, which can be accessed through a smart contract function that securely resolves the username to its associated wallet address. To ensure security, only usernames linked to a smart accounts will be resolvable, protecting against impersonation and errors. More details on this implementation have also been included in our technical document.\n\nKey Features and Benefits of SocketFi\n-----------------------------------------\n\n-   Convenience and Accessibility: Social media login streamlines account creation and access, eliminating the need for password management and encouraging broader adoption.\n    \n-   Enhanced Security: Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and encrypted sensitive data ensure secure account verification without exposing private information, protecting users from phishing and brute-force attacks.\n    \n-   Streamlined User Experience: New users benefit from a simple onboarding process, while returning users enjoy quick access without re-verification.\n    \n-   Account Abstraction: Offers flexibility by allowing users to switch between external wallets and social media accounts, ensuring robust access management.\n    \n-   Engagement Incentives: Users earn rewards for wallet usage and participation in blockchain activities, boosting ecosystem involvement.\n    \n\nEcosystem Impact\n--------------------\n\nSocketFi provides distinct benefits and advantages to the Soroban and Stellar ecosystems, these includes:\n\n-   User Expansion: Simplifies Web3 access for social media users, driving adoption of Soroban and Stellar by lowering technical barriers.\n    \n-   Increased Network Activity: Incentivizes wallet use, participation in dApps, and engagement with Stellar-based projects, enhancing transaction volumes and ecosystem growth.\n    \n-   Enhanced Ecosystem Visibility: Partnerships with dApps and DeFi protocols highlight Soroban's capabilities, attracting developers and users from other blockchains.\n    \n-   Seamless dApp Onboarding: Integrates Stellar-based dApps within the wallet, offering a unified user experience that encourages exploration of the Stellar ecosystem.\n    \n-   Community Advocacy: Incentive programs and quests foster active community participation, building a supportive network that strengthens Soroban and Stellar's long-term resilience.\n    \n\nSocketFi not only simplifies Web3 onboarding for social media users but also amplifies the Soroban and Stellar ecosystems through adoption, engagement, and visibility.",

          "projectDescription": "OneClick.Fi offers an all-in-one DeFi onboarding platform to help web3 users get access to the best DeFi protocols/opportunities in one click with simple UX, gamification, and AI-powered risk assessments. DeFi Explorer: One Click will act as a comprehensive aggregator, allowing users to manage DeFi activities across multiple chains, including Stellar. This makes it easier for users to find and interact with Stellar-based DeFi opportunities, improving accessibility for all experience levels.\n\nAI Portfolio Builder: One Click\u2019s AI will analyze user wallets, including Stellar-based assets, to recommend the best DeFi strategies. This helps users create portfolios tailored to their risk tolerance and find yield opportunities within Stellar's ecosystem.\n\nOne-Click Zaps: This feature enables users to execute complex DeFi actions, like providing liquidity, on Stellar in one transaction. It simplifies cross-chain interactions and ensures that users can engage with Stellar-based DeFi pools effortlessly.\n\nGamified Yield Farming: One Click will introduce fun, interactive elements like automated airdrops and reward quests for Stellar-based DeFi. This engages users and encourages them to maximize returns on Stellar through a playful experience.\n\nUPDATE since the previous SCF #30 submission of OneClick.Fi (Link to original submission: https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/rec83kMMeg4sWdkla)\n\nQuestion 1: While the idea of earning yields from top protocols on other chains is interesting, it doesn\u2019t appear to directly contribute to bringing liquidity into the Stellar ecosystem. Focusing on how to retain liquidity within Stellar or how the project can benefit Stellar-based protocols more clearly would help address this concern.  \n\nAnswer:\n\nWe will retain liquidity within Stellar and benefit Stellar-based protocols through the following products deployed by OneClick.Fi:\n\n-   Yield Explorer - the frontend for exploring every DeFi pool on every protocol on Stellar network. Yield Explorer will directly showcase the yield pools of Stellar protocols, allow users to do their due diligence, and provide users simple access to the opportunities\n    \n-   Portfolio Builder - for users who don't know where to start in DeFi, they can use Portfolio Builder to create a customized/personalized portfolio of DeFi pools on Stellar. Newbie users use OneClick's Portfolio Builder and see the Stellar pools and protocols as the end result of their onboarding. This will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem\n    \n-   Airdrop Tracker + Stellar Spaces - we will create a dedicated \"Space\" for Stellar Ecosystem that will showcase the available protocols in Stellar Ecosystem, quests, giveaways, or other promotional campaigns available in the ecosystem. In the end, users will be able to see the \"Stellar Space\" with all the available campaigns and activities which will directly drive liquidity and usage to the Stellar ecosystem.\u00a0\n    \n\nYou will find the links to demo of some of the features below as well as in the presentation.\n\n  \n\nAnd although OneClick.Fi delivers DeFi smoothness across a set of networks, additionally, the Stellar Network would be prioritized on the user interface in a variety of ways, for instance by:\n\n-   Showing Stellar protocols and yield pools in the \"Featured\" section of Yield Explorer\n    \n-   Including Stellar opportunities as a one of the default options for the portfolio creation for Portfolio Builder\n    \n-   Putting Stellar Spaces in the front row / top of the UI for users to explore\n    \n-   Proactive banners and comparison of Stellar opportunities to other network opportunities\n    \n-   Etc. the exact details will be furnished\n    \n-   In addition to that, OneClick.Fi would partner with all the Stellar protocols/project (would need help from Stellar community with introductions) and organize educational campaigns to bring more awareness about the Stellar ecosystem. That would include:\n    \n-   Educational content (blog posts, threads, newsletters) about Stellar, protocols, and ecosystem around\n    \n-   AMAs with protocol founders/core team\n    \n-   Spaces, videos, podcasts with protocol founders/core team\n    \n-   ... And other activities that would bring more exposure to Stellar network. OneClick.Fi will essentially become Stellar's front page of DeFi as well as a global awareness machine with the goal of making people aware that there are cool things in Stellar DeFi and that it still exists (many crypto users don't even know that Stellar exists or is still alive after 2017-2018). We are here to change that in a simple, fun, and gamified way.\n    \n\n  \n\nQuestion 2: Additionally, the deliverables are not well-organized, making it challenging to follow the development plan. A clearer breakdown of milestones and deliverables in a logical sequence would improve the proposal\u2019s structure.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAs described in the original submission/proposal, the implementation deliverables would be covered related to release of the features described above. The goal is to deploy each feature to support Stellar.\u00a0\n\n-   Deliverable 1: Yield Explorer\n    \n-   Deliverable 2: Airdrop Tracker + Stellar Spaces (Protocol+Asset database)\n    \n-   Deliverable 3: Portfolio Builder\n    \n-   Deliverable 4: One-Click Zap function\n    \n\nThe specific scope and criteria for these deliverables are mentioned in the original submission/proposal too.\u00a0  \n\nLinks and additional materials:\n\n-   Proposal deck about Stellar x OneClick.Fi integration - https://docsend.com/view/5rc8mt5pwzv4kkca\n    \n\n-   Demo UI Airdrop Tracker - https://defi.oneclick.fi/airdrops/\n    \n-   Demo UI Portfolio Builder -- https://defi.oneclick.fi/\n    \n-   Demo UI Yield Explorer - https://defi.oneclick.fi/pools",

          "projectDescription": "We\u2019re live on Testnet and now we\u2019ll improve contracts, go live on Mainnet, and provide tools to secure user funds with Keepers DeFindex helps wallet providers manage DeFi investment vaults by addressing key challenges such as fund security, risk mitigation, and yield optimization. Having launched on Testnet, we now aim to improve our contracts, transition to Mainnet, and leverage Keepers to rescue funds if a strategy becomes unhealthy. Wallet providers will also be able to earn fees from the yield generated on deposited funds.\n\nOur strategies utilize existing DeFi protocols on Soroban, such as auto-compounding with Blend, where USDC is supplied, BLND rewards are swapped for USDC, and reinvested. To enhance these strategies, we will refine our contracts, collaborate with an audit company (funded by the Audit Bank), and prepare for Mainnet deployment.\n\nTo secure user funds, we will develop Keepers using Mercury\u2019s infrastructure, integrating Zephyr Programs for metrics and automation tools for execution. These tools will enable wallet providers to automate fund rescues for risky strategies and gather metrics for informed rebalancing.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to enhance the user experience for creating vaults, ensuring a seamless and intuitive design that simplifies onboarding and platform interaction.\n\nRead more athttps://docs.defindex.io/",
