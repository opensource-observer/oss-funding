But built for everyday users Hana is a multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet designed to empower users with the capability to manage, transact, and interact with a diverse range of digital assets and applications across various blockchains. In our SCF Activation grant, we successfully integrated Stellar support into our Chrome, iOS, and Android applications. Our goal now is to build on this initial work to integrate Soroban Defi protocols natively into Hana.\n\nThe goal of this grant is to build a quick and easy onboarding onto Stellar for non-crypto users via OnRamp/OffRamp and existing-crypto users via cross-chain swaps, and a seamless Defi experience of Soroban protocols.\n\nOver the past few months, the Hana team has been working with a range of teams building in the Soroban ecosystem. We\u2019ve been aiming to learn what is being built and how we can natively integrate these protocols into Hana. The initial work we\u2019re doing in this grant will allow us to easily add additional Soroban protocols in the future.",

IDUNU: A fundraising and fund distribution platform for high-impact, cost-effective charities working with underprivileged kids.\n\nGoal: Empowering charities focused on underprivileged children through a sustainable and transparent, Stellar-powered fundraising and fund distribution platform.\n\nThe Problem We're Solving: There are over 98 million out-of-school children in Africa (200 million worldwide), and those still in school lack basic learning materials to achieve their dreams. The next generation of digital technologists needs help. NGOs like The Helpmates Foundation and Teens Trust Foundation struggle to raise funds for their annual school initiatives due to the country's dire economic situation.\n\nSummarily:\n- NGOs face significant challenges in raising funds for educational initiatives due to economic constraints.\n- There is a high number of out-of-school children, and those in school often need more essential learning materials.\n- Raising and distributing funds needs more transparency, affecting donor confidence and willingness to contribute.\n\nOverall results with Activation stage:\n1. Beta Phase: We started the beta phase with two NGOs, The Helpmates Foundation and Teen Trust Foundation where we refined our product development and also submitted tens of transactions to the Stellar Testnet Network. We also started signing up NGOs on our waitlist during this period.\n\n2. Public Launch: We launched! Our public launch has been with great praise. Here are our results so far and counting:\nA - We've signed 20 NGOs/charities on our platform. These NGOs have a combined outreach of 1 million kids across Nigeria. We're currently in talks with onboarding NGOs in other African countries like Ghana.\nB - Over 1,000,000 naira has been raised from campaigns. We currently support XLM and USDC donations. We're working on integrating more currencies like Naira and Ghana's Cedis.\nC - The platform has reduced the average time from fundraising to fund distribution to under 1 hour, a significant improvement over traditional methods. For example, GoFundMe takes 3-5 business days.\nD - More people now know how blazingly fast and cheap the Stellar blockchain is. Compared to traditional platforms like GoFundMe, which charge 2-3% for donations, our transactions vary between 0.00001 and 0.0005 XLM! How amazing!\n\nThe heart of IDUNU's success lies in its integration with the Stellar blockchain network. Stellar's open blockchain payment system offers unparalleled price, security, and transparency for online transactions, making it an ideal backbone for a platform like IDUNU. By bridging the gap between donors' generosity and children's needs, IDUNU stands as a testament to the power of technology to drive social change.\n\nFor the community stage, we will be building the following features:\n1. Charity Pay - Simplifying Donations: This payment link feature allows NGOs to create standalone payment pages independent of specific campaigns. It will build upon the Stellar transactions system we've built. This flexibility enables organizations to receive funds for general purposes, catering to operational costs or emergent needs that might not be tied to a particular project.\n2. Support for more currencies - Broadening Donor Base: We currently support USDC and XLM. This works really well now because it caters to the platform's biggest donors, who are from the diaspora community. In 2023, over 200 million migrant workers sent $669 billion to people back home in low- and middle-income countries. Integration to Stellar Anchor, Busha has helped with fund distribution, but as we expand to more African countries, we need to support more currencies. We will do this by integrating more of Busha's Stellar Anchor facilities and exploring integrations with Stellar Anchors in other countries like Ghana, such as Flutterwave and Yellowcard. Our integration with LINK.io's NGN token was put on hold because of current Nigerian regulatory issues and their restrictive integration policies, but we plan to revisit our collaboration.\n3. Diverse Wallet Integrations - Support for more wallets: We currently only do Stellar Freighter Wallet. For the community awards stage, we will support Xbull, Albedo, Ledger, WalletConnect, etc.\n4. Receipts for Tax purposes - Donation tax deduction receipt: To encourage and reward charitable giving, the platform will provide auto-generated donation tax deduction receipts showing verifiable Stellar chain-based proof, making it easier for donors to claim tax benefits.\n5. Proof of donation NFT: When we finish our core deliverables for this stage, we will provide Proof of donation NFTs to donors using Soroban smart contracts. This feature offers a novel digital token of appreciation that serves as a memento of their generosity and opens up new avenues for engaging and motivating the donor community. This will be done freely as a volunteer act and is not included in our budget.\n6. Personalized Charity Page: Each NGO will have its own page, just like a GoFundMe charity page, showing all its campaigns, donations, and community updates from the charity.\n7. Extensive Donation Subscription System - Ensuring Sustained Support: NGOs can get a consistent/ongoing stream of donations from donors interested in their mission. We will set up a system that accepts donors' emails, automatically creates payment links, and sends periodic (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual) reminders to the specified donor lists.\n\nThese features are critical to the long-term sustainability of the charities and our platform, and we're excited to get started!",

Meru is a non-custodial USDc digital wallet built and designed for freelancers and remote workers from Latin America, built over Stellar. Now we want to expand this to other emerging countries, such as India, Pakistan, Philippines, Bangladesh, etc., who have a very important presence of freelancer workers who work not only for the US but also for European companies. For this we need: Complement our KYC partner capabilities to have global coverage. Enable SEPA virtual bank accounts for non-EU residents, that settle in EURC (Stellar). Enable Mastercard/Visa issuance for global customers. Connect other on-ramp and off-ramp rails to at least 10 more countries outside Latam.\n\nRegarding studies around 1.56Bn people work as self-employed or freelancers in the world (https://techjury.net/blog/freelance-statistics/). Freelancers and remote workers commonly engage with remote employers through platforms like UpWork, Workana, Freelancer.com, Fiverr, etc. But getting paid internationally is still too hard. Most platforms pay in dollars or euros and leave the worker to figure out how to get that money into local currency to be available to spend on essentials like rent, food, medicines, wifi, etc., losing money paying high fees, having to use multiple platforms to convert the money to local currency, waiting long times, or being scammed.\n\nTotal flexibility to receive deposits, send or spend money with Meru, thanks to our non-custodial solution based on USDC/EURC on Stellar.\n\nWe have been working with SDF for more than 3 years. Meru has been built on Stellar. All the products offered by us are running on Stellar. When a Fiat payment is received it is converted to USDC/EURC and deposited in a non-custodial wallet owned by each user. We perform gas sponsorship, and fee bump transactions, to simplify adoption, and additionally, we have a key management and recovery system based on the SEP-30 protocol. We have our own instance of Horizon. We use SEP-6 and SEP-24 to integrate with Stellar anchors, such as Moneygram.",

          "projectName": "The Mercury Ecosystem - Mercury",
          "createdAt": "2024-03-17T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "Mercury is an efficient and already-running (testnet and mainnet) indexing service which we're looking to scale. The introduction of protocol 20 led to new challenges with respect to on-chain data access, signaling the need for complex, granular and customizable data retrieval. That\u2019s where indexers come into the picture, trying to fill the gap between on-chain projects and efficient data fetching. Mercury is a managed indexer specifically tailored for the Stellar-Soroban ecosystem built by the Xycloo Labs team. Its architecture allows for high efficiency which is reflected on the end user experience as fast, reliable, granular and cheap data indexing. To learn more about Mercury\u2019s advantages and how we tackle the new challenges of data needs on the network check out https://blog.xycloo.com/blog/explaining-mercury-stellar-event.\n\nMany important projects being built on Stellar and Soroban are already relying on Mercury for their data indexing: the Freighter Wallet, Soroswap Finance, Soroban Governor, Kwickbit, SmartDeploy, xycLoans and individuals. Their teams are working closely with Tommaso aka tdep (our lead developer), especially for what concerns the integration with Zephyr, as we still need to integrate a more complete SDK and facilitate the developer experience (more on that later). We believe that this is already a good amount of traction given that Soroban has just now started getting traction and the service has been operational only for a couple of months. However, we\u2019ve noticed that:\n\nOnce clients start relying on Mercury and get past the initial learning curve, they always continue working with us.\n\nWe\u2019ve only worked closely with projects whose developers were already very familiar with Stellar and Soroban.\n\nThere\u2019s a good percentage of customers we recognized to have less experience with Soroban that signed up or requested access and then didn\u2019t persist with using the service.\n\nThe above insights have led us to formulate what is one of the two main components of this submission: making Mercury a fully-featured data-related ecosystem. With this submission we propose to implement and outline Mercury's significant potential to capture a substantial market share and establish itself as a leader in developing services that bridge the gap between the network\u2019s data and various user groups, including developers, traders, and general users. We want to make Mercury the one-stop service to plug-in projects, set up simple or complex data workflows, simulate transactions, build bots, explore and test contracts, and possibly other data-related features that can scale up the workflows of projects building on Soroban and Stellar. All of this would be accessible to all users in a user-friendly Mercury ecosystem dashboard that doesn\u2019t necessarily require a deep understanding of the underlying network data structure or format, and providing features such as auto-generated code for frontends when interacting with Mercury.\n\nWe also believe that it is crucial in this phase of users and developers onboarding for Soroban to provide the network with the best infrastructure possible in order to reduce at maximum the entry barriers. Having a powerful, managed, omni-comprehensive and user-friendly environment to deal with network\u2019s data is a huge step forward in that direction, making available a full suite of components that would significantly simplify the processes.\n\nMore concretely, the submission can be split in two components (not necessarily of equal amount of work):\n\nScaling the ZephyrVM integration.\n\nBuilding the \u201cMercury ecosystem\u201d.\n\nScaling the ZephyrVM integration\n\nThe current version of the ZephyrVM works well, but only for teams that are much familiar with Soroban and Rust (outlining the need for better tooling and more work on the SDK). Additionally, the ZephyrVM is meant to replace the need of running your own infrastructure with an indexer and retrieve in real time what you want (with total customizability) from the network by writing a \u201csimple\u201d program, and there are still many features missing to achieve real feature completion and have the service be in fact comparable with running your own infrastructure, including database-related features (full control over your tables or defining your own queries, which is currently done manually), and VM-specific improvements on the host environment to allow for more functionality (testing toolkit, better database client, env objects for optimization, websocket alerts, etc). Another very powerful feature we also want to implement is to allow for a serverless-alike functionality for certain defined functions, so that they can also potentially process their own queries in case the custom querying functionality we already aim to implement isn\u2019t enough. The ability to define such functions within your Zephyr program allows you to have full control over your tables (for example, have authorized functions that load data in the tables if required), over the querying (for if you need to for instance process scvals in the queries or simply need to form highly complex queries). Additionally, for programs that only need to access the current state (imagine an AMM router) you can write zephyr serverless functions to give the best path by simply accessing the ledger state and processing it, making it cheaper as it won\u2019t be executed for every ledger close. Specifics about these improvements can be found in the architecture document. This part of the submission, while probably the most \u201cboring\u201d one (thus why most of the details are in the architecture docs), is one of the most important and expensive in terms of time required. A complete ZephyrVM integration can be extremely powerful for the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem, extensively tightening the gap between projects and custom processed data. Once the code is safe we will also open-source the ZephyrVM (the code is currently available for a few trusted testers) and publish an open-source indexer reliant on zephyr programs which you can connect to your database. We still strongly believe that one of the biggest advantages of using Zephyr is for it to be no-setup without having to bear infra costs and maintenance, but some services might prefer their indexing to run on their own servers with the ability to build the ingestion logic leveraging the Zephyr SDK along with its tooling. The ZephyrVM integration is also part of the Mercury Ecosystem we describe below, having also it\u2019s management panel in the Mercury Dashboard we will later describe:\n\nBuilding the Mercury Ecosystem\n\nCompleting the ZephyrVM integration means that the ecosystem can now rely either on Mercury to easily subscribe and retrieve data directly from stellar core, or on a Zephyr program for when Mercury\u2019s pre-built structures aren\u2019t enough for the use-case. However, as mentioned before, we see the potential for Mercury to grow beyond its current state. To make Mercury the one-stop for projects to scale their on-chain apps, we propose 3 macro-components:\n\nThe Mercury dashboard and related components.\n\nThe Mercury \u201csimulator\u201d and ledger API.\n\nTesting studio.\n\nSimulator and Ledger API\n\nWe want projects and users that rely on Mercury to avoid the necessity of depending also on additional services to simulate their transactions or to access ledger entries (the two most common practices of the RPC). Because we\u2019re obviously already running our stellar core nodes to provide customers with data directly from the network, there\u2019s no added cost for us to implement a very lightweight and graphql version of the RPC\u2019s getLedgerEntries method. This ledger API can be easily integrated into a Mercury-specific fork of the new versions of Soroflare, an open source wrapper of Soroban\u2019s simulation with the possibility of customizing the ledger in the VMs state, also built by Tommaso (note: the work on Soroflare is not part of this submission). The resulting integration, along with a very light Mercury SDK (wrapper of stellar-sdk tx assembly for working with Mercury), will enable our customers to simulate their Soroban transactions and obtain the current ledger entries with expiration as well (note that the entries functionality already exists in Mercury, but will store the entire history of the entry). Note that the simulator is not a Soroban RPC and due to its design has also an important part of Mercury\u2019s \u201ctesting studio\u201d, which as you\u2019ll see below powers both Zephyr and Soroban testing activities.\n\nTesting Studio\n\nWhile it\u2019s relatively easy to write Zephyr code for Rust-familiar folks with a good understanding of the network\u2019s data structures, a big drawback that currently exists on Mercury is the inability to test the programs against meaningful data for your testing flows. To this purpose we will create a testing studio, both on the mercury dashboard and as helpers in the Zephyr SDK. You will have the possibility of simulating calls to an existing contract or load test snapshots from your contract\u2019s tests. Our sdk will do the heavy lifting to construct and translate the tests/execution results into ledgerclose metas and you\u2019ll be able to test Zephyr out, at least for what regards Soroban interactions. Besides being able to test Zephyr programs against real/tweaked data, the testing studio is also meant for users and developers to test Soroban itself, always with data-centered applications:\n\nSnapshot the network entries you\u2019re interested in within your Soroban rust tests through our SDK. This is particularly useful for contracts that are relying on other contracts in their workflows. For example, for testing out flash loans or oracle contracts without having to install and build them and by relying on real protocol data.\n\nFrom the dashboard, save and manage checkpoints of the ledger state you\u2019re interested into to replay them either in soroban tests or Zephyr programs.\n\nFrom the dashboard, interact with on-chain contracts without actually submitting transactions (a gadget that can be potentially embedded also by dapps for witnessing and visualizing actual effects of the transaction without submitting it).\n\nAgain, this non-zephyr part of the testing studio is specifically designed for Soroban applications that are relying on other contracts, so besides the testing ease of trying out your code interacting with real chain data within your cargo tests (which is cool, but unit testing for production protocols should generally also rely on a \u201cblank\u201d or no-state version of the chain, i.e the tests-only snapshots), it\u2019s perfect for things like arbitraging contracts, flash loan liquidation contracts, etc which will generally also need to index data off-chain to trigger execution. We don\u2019t aim to provide a full testing framework for Soroban, but rather to provide our clients (or whoever needs to index data) with the best experience possible given the resources we have already available from the other features of the environment.\n\nDashboard\n\nThe dashboard is the UI that enables access to all of the features offered by Mercury, while also helping customers manage data subscriptions, Zephyr activity, simulation and testing under named projects. Similarly to Web2 developer-oriented services, the dashboard would serve the purpose of creating projects and managing all of the components. The dashboard in Mercury also has the purpose of highly lowering the entry barrier required for working with Mercury. For example, developers will be able to rely on our Subscriptions Builder: this will be integrated with the Mercury Transaction Simulator, so users will be able to simulate transactions from our dashboard (or they will also able to import test snapshots from your Soroban rust tests) and display all emitted events and changed/created entries, which you can click on to open a dialogue for creating subscriptions starting from that structure\u2019s layout. The dashboard is also responsible for all the generated code snippets that we provide the users with to immediately get started into integrating Mercury\u2019s indexing and transactions simulation, testament to the fact that we plan for indexing to be easy for all developers, even entry-level developers trying to test Soroban/Stellar. Below is an example of how we envision combining some of these dashboard features to create a new Mercury-only (no Zephyr) project, set up subscriptions and get your code snippets to immediately provide your front ends with Mercury\u2019s indexing and simulation capabilities:\n\nUser defines the initial settings for their lending protocol data workflow:\n\nUser imports test snapshots from rust SDK to display data segments their can subscribe to (with all the required customization for smart contract objects, so for instance in this example subscribe to all entry changes that have a vector that begins with the balance symbol as contractdata key scval):\n\nPreview all the snippets to retrieve and parse the data you\u2019re about to subscribe to with Mercury simulation snippets for your methods as well if needed.",

          "projectDescription": "Streamlining Horizon API and Soroban RPC node deployment and management. Forge is a Horizon-as-a-service and RPC-node-as-a-service platform.\n\nStellar's native Horizon service is a good service right now, but we envision that with the growth of the ecosystem it might become overcrowded and communities may want to have their own Horizon-as-a-service node. When it comes to RPC nodes, based on our research, the majority of the current RPC providers are bigger companies not necessarily targeting startups/SMBs with their pricing - https://developers.stellar.org/network/soroban-rpc/rpc-providers.\n\nWe believe that by building Forge natively for Soroban we will be able to better coordinate and suit our product offerings/price to the growing ecosystem of new startups. When it comes to the challenges of scalability and managing huge data that is being kicked out by the network, we will be using the following approach:\n\nHorizon-as-a-service - We will be using the Enterprise n-Tier approach, where data will be ingested using redundant captive core instances. At the same time we will have several API servers running as those do not require much processing and storage themselves - data is stored in DB cluster - 1 API role instance for each client, also maybe transaction submission role if requested. Our plan is to have 1 database cluster and up to 5 API instances in the beginning. As we will be monitoring the system we may increase the number of API instances based on different metrics. In the future we plan to make a copy of the whole cluster not to have DB as the single point of failure - follow the Redundant Hot Backup schema - https://developers.stellar.org/network/horizon/admin-guide/scaling#redundant-hot-backup. That way we'll make the system more fail-safe and scalable.\n\nSoroban RPC as a service - if a user wants to spin up Soroban RPC we can provide that service as well - we will create the same architecture - single scalable database and several Soroban RPC services to save storage and network resources.\n\nFor now the plan is to store 30 day history and then increase the history window gradually as more and more users use the service. We will be using a Load Balancer for serving user requests. We will be running a single (or maybe two, for redundancy measures) node as a public gateway of our infra and propagating data inside the infra for the Ingestion.\n\nCopy-on-write and database sharding are interesting areas for us to explore. While this is not part of the submission, we will explore these technologies to see how difficult/efficient it will be to implement them. When it comes to infrastructure, after receiving a request to create a node for a new customer, our automation and orchestration tool (AOT) will connect to Cloud Provider API and request to create a dedicated virtual machine with predefined configuration (CPU, RAM, Storage). We can configure our AOT to interact and deploy nodes with different Cloud Providers including big ones like AWS/Azure/GoogleCloud and any small ones like Hetzner/Linode/Vultr, also it could interact with on-premise virtualization like VMware/Proxmox/Nutanix. We also can deploy nodes directly on different managed Kubernetes clusters in cloud or on-premise. For now, we choose to use dedicated and individual nodes for customers to have predefined and guaranteed performance, for start we think to provide nodes with 4 CPU / 8GB RAM.\n\nWe are also exploring an option to deploy our own bare metal infra in North America and Georgia (Eastern Europe) to optimize our cost base and offer a lower price to our clients.\n\nOur target audience are startups. We believe that all the activation and community awards grantees are a perfect audience for us to outreach. Since the ecosystem is so early, it's so much easier to develop strong partnership bonds.",

          "projectDescription": "Sora is your essential companion toolkit for developing Soroban smart contracts. Developing Soroban smart contracts on Stellar requires a deep understanding of soroban-cli, a command-line tool filled with numerous commands, arguments, and frequent changes that can be complex and intimidating, thus making the development process error-prone and cumbersome. Such challenges can slow down development, deter developers from fully exploring the capabilities of Soroban, and thereby limit its adoption.\n\nSoroban CLI GUI was born to address these challenges by providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) application that abstracts soroban-cli to simplify the process of developing Soroban smart contracts. It provided a point-and-click interface to reduce the learning curve and potential for manual errors associated with command-line interactions, thereby making Soroban more accessible to a wider audience of developers and users. After its initial release, it was well received by the developer community with 10+ stars, 25+ downloads, and positive feedback in two weeks.\n\nSoroban CLI GUI now becomes SORA to reflect its broader scope and enhanced capabilities. Evolving into SORA, the tool transitions beyond merely a GUI for soroban-cli, embodying a comprehensive suite aimed at enriching the Soroban development journey. New features like the Events Page for real-time contract event monitoring, the Lab Page for delving into Soroban's experimental functionalities, and the AI Command Constructor for translating natural language into executable commands, SORA is redefining the ease of Soroban contract development. This evolution is further supported by a Soroban AI Assistant for on-demand guidance, a VS Code Helper Extension for integrated development workflows, and substantial user experience improvements, ensuring that SORA not only simplifies but also elevates the development of Soroban smart contracts.\n\nThis is the second submission of our project, following the approval of our initial proposal after a budget reduction, as we had applied with an idea rather than an MVP. Now, we present a fully functional project that has shown significant progress in development and user engagement, rebranded as SORA. With this submission, we are seeking its justified budget to further develop and enhance SORA's capabilities, ensuring continuous improvement and maintenance to become a demanded tool for Soroban smart contract development among developers.\n\nYou can watch the demo here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHP7ZM4MlGhPxSExTLoUOV9m2jbDKet/view?usp=drivelink\n\nSora Benefits:\n\nSimplifies the complex process of developing Soroban smart contracts, enhancing the developer experience, making it more accessible to all skill levels.\n\nReduces the potential for manual errors in command execution, leading to a smoother development process with actionable error messages and tips.\n\nAbstracting over soroban-cli through user-friendly forms and interactive elements, enabling developers to efficiently execute commands, build and deploy contracts, with minimal error and without manual CLI interactions.\n\nTransforms natural language commands into executable Soroban commands with the command constructor, streamlining the development workflow.\n\nProvides instant, Soroban-related query through the Soroban AI Assistant, enhancing learning and problem-solving for developers.\n\nIntegrates seamlessly with VS Code, optimizing the development experience without needing to switch contexts.",

          "projectDescription": "Sanctumis a non-custodial privacy-preserving payment system, with several compliance-friendly safety features. Sanctum is a non-custodial privacy-enhancing payment system. Transactions on Sanctum are private by default, meaning the identities of the senders and recipients are unknown to the public and the amounts are also hidden. Moreover, the system targets regulatory compliance by implementing the following features:\n\n- Blacklisting: When a user is blacklisted, say in response to a warrant or a known DeFi exploit, any transaction where that user is a sender or a recipient can be decrypted by an authorized party. That is, the law enforcement party is provided a decryption key for accessing all transactions involving that blacklisted user. The key is generated by a decentralized mechanism where, say, all parties in a committee approve the decryption request upon verifying the warrant. The access structure policy implemented by this committee is configurable -- for instance, any m out of n committee members can approve the request.\n- Proof of Innocence: As the set of blacklisted addresses grows, any payment must additionally prove that the sender and recipient are not blacklisted users, based on the most recent database of blacklisted users. This so-called proof-of-innocence is zero-knowledge, thus providing anonymity.\n- Anti-Money Laundering: Sanctum attempts to provide anti-money laundering (AML) by enforcing a privacy budget, wherein transactions remain fully private only until a certain cumulative threshold (say $10,000 a month) and any transaction that exceeds the threshold can be decrypted by an authorized party (e.g., a law enforcement party).\n- Anonymous Credentials: Sanctum provides each user with a credential, which can be issued as a result of the KYC process. Sanctum works with the anon-creds system and is therefore agnostic of the identity provider. Sanctum verifies that a payment only occurs between users that have a valid credential, although the private attributes of the credential are never leaked.",

          "projectDescription": "Proof of Concept implementation of FROST, a threshold signature scheme based on the Schnorr signature, using the WebRTC protocol. The goal of this project is to implement a threshold signature protocol that provides a scalable, performant, flexible, and privacy-preserving alternative to the current multisignature solution used in the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem.\n\nThe current multisignature implementation with a threshold t does not scale well with the number of participants (maximum of 20) because t signatures need to be submitted on-chain and verified in consensus. If more than t signatures are submitted, the transaction fails. Besides that, the network knows which accounts signed the transaction, which is not good for privacy.\n\nOur proposal solves these issues because the FROST protocol is done completely off-chain. It starts with a Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where a secret key is generated that no single participant knows of. Instead, the participants generate shares of that secret key, that they can later use to sign a transaction. This is done by using the Pedersen's variation of the Shamir's secret sharing scheme, which allows the participants to verify their shares and does not require a trusted dealer. Our solution is:\n- More scalable and more performant: Only a single Ed25519 signature is submitted to the network and is independent of the number of signers.\n- More flexible: The number of signers is flexible between a minimum threshold t and the total number of participants in the protocol n.\n- More private: The output Ed25519 signature is indistinguishable from any other signature on the network, and the signers are not known because the signing protocol happens off-chain.",

One module to rule them all.\n\nTaking advantage of NestJS's versatility, stellar-nest provides a pre-configurable module. This means that both users unrelated to the Stellar ecosystem and those aiming to accelerate their Node.js development will find a pleasant surprise when using stellar-nest.\n\nDrawing on the best practices recommended in the Stellar documentation, this module will enable a quick start. However, it will remain fully customizable depending on the development needs and will adapt accordingly. For instance, initializing the module in 'TESTNET' mode would generate an instance of the serverService pointing to the testnet server, utilizing the appropriate Network Passphrase depending on the mode. Nevertheless, this doesn't compromise power; at any point, you can modify the server configuration directly from the module, and this configuration would be applied to the serverService (which is actually the extended Horizon.server class).\n\nFor example, upon creating accounts, you could establish an initial trustline or choose an initial balance, all according to business rules. All of this will be completely customizable from the module configuration.\n\nOne module to bring them all.\n\nAlthough it could be useful for various use cases, one of the main objectives is to accelerate certain processes and introduce Stellar to non-blockchain developers. With this recommended default configuration, it would be easy for them to integrate Stellar into their projects even if they are not directly related to blockchain.\n\nIn the land of development, where magic meets code, stellar-nest proposes working based on use cases, making it more intuitive to choose the utility to use depending on the circumstance. Leveraging the magic of TypeScript and Nest, a series of decorators, pipes, and additional functionalities are being prepared.\n\nAn easy example would be the balance decorator @BalanceParam(). For instance, a startup's service may want to retrieve the balance of an account based on a parameter, body, or formData when a controller is used, without needing to adapt the logic to fetch balances. @BalanceParam allows specifying the parameter name, along with additional configuration such as specifying the asset_code to know the exact balance of that account, thus enabling early return if a certain condition is not met, even before executing other logics.",

I as a developer who already have a couple of contracts in Futurenet, Testnet, and Mainnet where each one of them has different accounts, different keys, different numbers, variables, and a big etc have faced this exact same problem and I'm 100% sure many more will face it in the future because the more the network grows, the more contracts will need to be managed.\n\nSo, here comes SorobanHub. SorobanHub is a single desktop app that serves as your control center and it allows you to keep everything organized in a single place. If you're like us that we need to manage SorobanDomains, WenMeridian, and FxDAOs contracts on different networks at the same time, you will find that using command line files can get messy pretty quickly.\n\nSorobanHub is not just an \"extension\" of the Soroban CLI, instead, it is an app that uses different tools available like the Soroban CLI, the Stellar SDK, and others to make the management tasks easier. From simple things like checking the expiration date of key values on your contracts to more complex stuff like upgrading your contracts and executing them directly from the interface.\n\nAnd because we know this is a tool that could add a lot of value to the ecosystem, we believe it should be free to use to all developers on the network so that's why it will be a free to download and use desktop app.",

          "projectDescription": "Educational video content about Soroban and Stellar for over 160.000 followers. Cross border payments, CBDCs and smart contracts. I am a content creator in TikTok, Youtube, Instagram, Telegram, Twitter/X with over 160,000 followers. I have been sharing content about the Stellar ecosystem for over 3 years now. And I would love to keep sharing about Stellar and Soroban. My proposal is to do a video campaign for the Spanish-speaking audience which focuses on explaining the 4 main objectives of the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem:\n\nDeFi and smart contracts with Soroban\nTokenization\nPayments\nOn and off ramps\n\nWithin these 4 broad topics, I would speak about the following:\n\nStellar as a solution for the unbanked\nStellar meets the real world: Over 81,000 locations, CBDCs, tokenization.\nSoroban: A big opportunity for builders\nDeFi in Soroban: Create a wallet and use protocols\nStellar as an access to the global financial system\nCBDCs in Stellar: The blockchain for the future of money\nRemittances and payments: Moneygram and Stellar unite forces\nHow easy it is to swap the money from the real world to USDC with Stellar and Moneygram\nCircle launches EURC on Stellar\nStellar as a fast, cheap, and far more energy efficient blockchain\n\nThe video and written content will revolve around these topics. I would highlight how Stellar is focusing on CBDCs and asset tokenization, on ramps with collaborations like the one with Moneygram, and how Soroban will give Stellar smart contracts to work with all the assets on the Stellar network. Targeting both users and builders. Soroban, the new smart contract platform, needs visibility among DeFi users, and not only users, but also developers that will find Soroban through my content. The campaign's 88 varied content pieces, including long format videos, 100-second videos, written articles, and X posts, aim to educate on programmable money, blockchain, and fiat-crypto integration. With a target of 450,000 to 900,000 views, it aims to boost Soroban's adoption in fintech.\n\nWhat the problem it solves, how it solves them, and what audience it solves them for:\n\nThis content campaign about Stellar and Soroban addresses two issues that, in my opinion, exist within Stellar: low presence on social media and lack of awareness about Soroban. To increase visibility, we would implement a strategy combining short vertical videos, long horizontal videos, stories, web articles, and posts on X for over 160,000 crypto-enthusiast followers. This campaign is dedicated to the Spain and LATAM community. Stellar has limited presence in these regions. However, with a reach of over 600,000 views, this community will engage more with the ecosystem, using XLM, creating wallets, and exploring Soroban's DeFi.\n\nThis is a list of videos where I speak about other blockchain\u2019s and DeFi protocols\u2019 in my social media accounts:\n\nStellar Blockchain: Payments, CBDCs and on ramps: https://youtu.be/Jbl8tzq1ll4?si=trOdX61t-83vy8FB\nAvalanche Partnerships with Subnets: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVP6WW/\nChainlink oracle partnerships: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVMY77/\nEigenLayer and what it means for Ethereum: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVkc1V/\nDePIN projects and their tokenomics: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUV6NwK/\nFantom: SONIC and Fantom Virtual Machine: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUV4g5Y/\nRipple\u2019s future AMM: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVHMe6/\nChainflip: DEX for non EVM blockchains (like Thorchain): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVDa27/\nThorchain vs Thorswap: What\u2019s the difference: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVPVaF/\nTokenized US Bonds: RWA on Blockchain: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVVmL5/\nChainlink example for RWAs: Tesla https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVDos3/\nBank of America suggests using Ripple\u2019s ODL https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUVM36X/\n\nAnd for Youtube:\n\nStellar Blockchain: Payments, CBDCs and on ramps: https://youtu.be/Jbl8tzq1ll4?si=trOdX61t-83vy8FB\nStargate: LayerZero technology for stablecoins swaps: https://youtu.be/CTEP2nPTx9k?si=AnygqodqdlyKkc6R\nAsset Tokenization on Avalanche: https://youtu.be/4JxwyXtOZOU?si=NMgMQ9PG7HRZeUIv\nChainlink: The best oracle and key for RWA: https://youtu.be/vNMVwATetqI?si=MKNTw-Xz7RblhBDb\nHow does Thorchain work? https://youtu.be/BdCWIzqHQ4Q?si=C2OZHc9IMMv347Ri\nHow to stake ETH?
