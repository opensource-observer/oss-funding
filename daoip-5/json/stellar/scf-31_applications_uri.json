We have successfully integrated the Flutter SDK for Stellar, enabling non-custodial wallet creation for our users. This integration ensures that users have full control of their funds, with a focus on security and transparency. We\u2019ve also implemented SEP 10 authentication to provide secure user authentication and SEP 24 to enable seamless cash-in and cash-out functionality through our strategic partnership with MoneyGram. This was the first crucial step in our journey to bridge cash-based economies with digital finance solutions. With this submission, we aim to take the next step by implementing SEP 30, which will allow for seamless onboarding without the need for a passphrase, significantly improving the user experience and simplifying wallet access for new users. This will remove one of the key barriers to adoption, making our platform more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, we have recently partnered with Stripe to enable seamless USDC account funding on the Stellar network across the US and European markets, further expanding our reach and providing more funding options for users. However, we are facing challenges with real-time USDC funding for Mobile Money top-ups in emerging markets such as West and Central Africa. While we are integrated with major Mobile Money providers, maintaining sufficient liquidity in our USDC pool is a critical bottleneck. This liquidity is essential to ensure smooth, real-time account funding and to fully leverage our partnerships with Stellar and MoneyGram. Given the strategic importance of these markets and their potential to drive significant transaction volumes on the Stellar network, we propose setting up a USDC liquidity pool. This pool will allow users to fund their wallets using local payment methods, ensuring real-time processing and further empowering users in underserved regions.",

          "projectDescription": "Implement the idOS on Stellar to unlock KYC-reusability even for obligated entities and user-owned data management The idOS is a decentralized identity and storage layer. It gives users the ability to be in control of their own data and dApps to make even KYC onboarding as smooth as signing a transaction.  \n  \nThe idOS is a network of nodes that stores user-encrypted data and uses a proof-of-state consensus to enforce user request. Unlike P2P decentralized storage providers, it allows for data privacy ( e.g.\u00a0GDPR) compliance.  \n  \nIn a world that finally sees self-custodial rails being used in the real world, especially for finance application, the idOS bridges identity user information over from one dApp and use case to another.  \n  \nImagine investing on a RWA platform and later wanting to offer this stake on an institutional DEX pool. Usually both cases would require a full KYC process. The idOS allows both entities to exchange this information with the consent of the user. Imagine, having a wallet that acts both as a bank account as well as a hub for various financial dApps: These use cases need an identity orchestration layer that the idOS provides.  \n  \nThe integration can be separated in three steps that finish with an implementation of the idOS into Stellar:\n\n1.  General implementation and system operability, specifically PPKP interoperability and message-signing recognition\n    \n1.  SEP-10 support and native wallet support\n    \n1.  SEP-12 integration to allow wallet --> Anchor or wallet --> dApp flows\n    \n\n  \nThe integration would allow a native and user-self-custodial passing of KYC information. It would e.g. allow Vibrant to connect to the idOS to securely store KYC information and enable user data management as well as KYC passing. It does not enable an attestation system for smart contract native identity gating use cases.",

          "projectName": "Implement the Swift Wallet SDK - Swift Wallet SDK",
          "createdAt": "2024-10-27T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "Implementation of the Swift Wallet SDK to offer native iOS developers the same functionality that is available in the TypeScript, Kotlin and Flutter Wallet SDKs. Interoperability between payment applications such as wallets and on/off ramps such as Stellar anchors has always been one of the most important pillars for Stellar. That's why the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) started defining standards for wallets and anchors very early on to facilitate their interoperability and to maximize the adoption.\n\nThe basic consideration here is that, from the wallet developer's point of view, it should make no difference whether they integrate with one anchor or with several different ones. The power of this interoperability standard is that you code once and ideally with very little modifications you can support multiple companies and you can provide a very competitive service in terms of your wallet offering.\n\nHowever, because these standards were defined very early on to maximize adoption, with very little information about the most important user cases, the consequence was that they had to be extended again and again over the last 10 years to reflect the wallet and anchor builder\u2019s needs. But evolving the standard is not an easy thing, you don\u2019t want to break anyone who is already compatible, so you need to create this backwards compatible evolution system that ends up becoming almost like a patchwork where you either grow by having a fixed set of endpoints with a lot of optional parameters or you have a bunch of endpoints that do slightly different things. It is probably impossible to get as close to a good API as if you had defined that from the go considering all the use cases and accommodated all of them. As a result, these standards have become very complex, extensive, and interconnected over time. See for example SEP-06 or SEP-24.\n\nThe standard API for interoperability between wallets and anchors was defined by SDF via so-called Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs). And the original recommendation for developers to become interoperable was to read the SEPs and implement them. However, since these are very complex, extensive and cover many edge cases, this led to many different interpretations during implementation.\n\nThat's why SDF came up with the idea of implementing so-called Wallet SDKs about two years ago. These are software libraries that implement the needed functionality and that developers can integrate into their program, so as not to keep reinventing the wheel over and over again.\n\nThe integration of a wallet SDK makes it very easy for the developer of a client application to become interoperable. They do not have to develop the communication with the anchor themselves, but only use the SDK. Furthermore, this helps to remain interoperable, because every time the standard evolves, a new version of the SDK is also released, and the developer only must update to use the new version of the library. It is a common, natural process for software developers. And, because the functionality is already implemented, developers can become interoperable much faster and at a much lower cost than if they were to implement the functionality from scratch themselves. This means that developers have more time to focus on implementing their business logic instead of constantly reinventing the wheel by having to implement Stellar details.\n\nWallet SDKs are currently offered for three different programming languages. The Stellar Development Foundation created and maintained the TypeScript and the Kotlin Wallet SDKs. And the Flutter (dart) Wallet SDK was developed and is maintained by me (Soneso). You can find their documentation on the official Stellar docs website under: Build a Wallet with the Wallet SDK.\n\nAll three SDKs offer the same functionality and the same interfaces for integration. These were defined by SDF when the TypeScript and Kotlin SDKs were implemented.\n\nThe new Swift Wallet SDK will implement all the current features of the other SDKs from the Wallet SDK family (Stellar Integration, SEP-01, SEP-10, SEP-09, SEP-12, SEP-24, SEP-06, SEP-38, SEP-30, SEP-07). As soon as new features are defined and implemented by SDF, the Swift Wallet SDK will grow with them. Like the other Wallet SDKs, the Swift Wallet SDK will be build upon the corresponding Horizon SDK, the Horizon iOS Stellar SDK, of which I am the main developer and maintainer.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the importance and usability of the Wallet SDKs, please check out this Meridian presentation by Alex Cordeiro (Senior Director, Engineering, SDF).",

          "createdAt": "2024-10-27T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "SiBorg is developing an on-chain sponsorship protocol that tokenizes advertising spaces across websites, newsletters, and Telegram channels. This enables sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers while creating a new asset class. SiBorg will integrate its existing system with Stellar's Soroban to leverage scalable architecture and efficient on/off-ramping solutions. What SiBorg Is\u00a0\nSiBorg is building a decentralized monetization protocol, transforming the visibility of media and creators into a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across multiple interfaces. This allows buyers to speculate on the future growth of publishers.\n\nThe Problem\nThere are no Web3-native sponsorship solutions. Apps and publishers have to rely on off-chain (and often opaque) methods to generate revenue from sponsors. While we are seeing more decentralized tools for the creator economy (e.g., Lens, Paragraph), current approaches to generating revenue still rely on traditional business models (gifts, subsriptions, advertising), which don\u2019t leverage tokenization opportunities. As a result, one cannot invest in the growth of a media outlet, creator, or app's visibility, they can only spend advertising budgets, stuck in a KPI-centric model.\nThe Solution\nWe are creating an on-chain sponsorship protocol that introduces a new asset class by tokenizing advertising spaces across websites, newsletters, and Telegram channels. This asset class transforms visibility into a tradable financial instrument, allowing sponsors to invest in the future growth of publishers, such as media outlets. Our solution builds trust and strengthens reputations by aligning the interests of sponsors, now seen as investors, with those of publishers. Publishers retain full control over the content displayed, preventing scammy ads from appearing. This also creates an additional revenue stream for publishers, who receive upfront payments and earn royalties from secondary market transactions. Publishers can join our marketplace to create tokenized offers for their ad spaces. Sponsors can then purchase these spaces and submit advertising proposals for publisher approval. Sponsors also benefit from a secondary market, where they can resell ad spaces or, in the future, even use them as collateral for loans.\n\nHow It Works and Its Use of Soroban\nWe\u2019ve already launched a first version on Base (EVM). Now, we\u2019re planning to deploy on the Stellar network using Soroban to take advantage of the scalable architecture and seamless global on and off-ramping capabilities.\n- \u201cDSponsor\u201d Smart Contracts (permissionless)\n    - These contracts handle the tokenization of ad spaces, turning visibility (like digital website parcels) into assets that can be traded.\n    - They also include DeFi and marketplace logic, as well as handlers for ad submission (on the sponsor side) and validation (on the publisher side). Important to note: The contracts store only data hashes, while actual files (such as logos) are stored on decentralized storage platforms like IPFS.\n- \u201cApp\u201d Frontend\u00a0\n    - The frontend allows both sponsors and publishers to interact with smart contracts, enabling features like login functionality, handling payments for tokenized ad spaces, and administration tools for managing ad campaigns.\n    - With a focus on user experience, the app is designed to operate without requiring any Web3 knowledge, ensuring ease of use with minimal transaction fees, near-instant settlements, and smooth on-ramping.\n- \u00a0\u201cRelayer\u201d API & SDK\n- GraphQL and REST APIs, along with SDKs in JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust, serve information from smart contract events to the frontend.\n- This system allows any publisher (creators, dApps, media outlets) to automatically integrate validated ads into their platforms, including websites, newsletters, Telegram channels, with more platforms to come.",

          "projectName": "Cede Labs: Unlocking liquidity between CeFi and DeFi effortlessly - Cede Labs",
          "createdAt": "2024-10-27T00:00:00",
          "projectDescription": "Cede Labs specializes in bridging the gap between Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by offering seamless, secure connectivity to over 15 Centralized Exchange (CEX) APIs. Our innovative solutions unlock liquidity from CEXs, enabling effortless integration for dApps and asset managers to optimize their operations without compromising user experience. The Problem:\nCEX connectivity presents significant challenges due to the tremendous lack of fluidity between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This disconnection prevents the seamless transfer of liquidity, with over 40% of crypto liquidity trapped in centralized exchanges, limiting the potential for DeFi innovation and broader ecosystems like Stellar. Moreover, existing liquidity gateway solutions are inefficient, expensive, or not user-friendly (FIAT on-ramp, Bridges, \u2026); with CEX integration being highly complex, especially for Web3 teams whose core expertise lies elsewhere. Adding to the difficulty, the maintenance of CEX API keys requires heavy ressources and continuous monitoring.\u00a0\n\nThe Solution:\nTo bridge the gap between CeFi & DeFi, Cede Labs is building two products:\u00a0\n\n- Cede.store:\nTo answer to a demand of DeFi & blockchain builders to bring more liquidity into their products (dApps, wallets, \u2026) in a simple way without spending money or development time, Cede Labs built cede.store.\u00a0\nCede.store is a non-custodial browser extension to store CEX (centralized exchanges) API keys and to sign CEX requests from the client-side. Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets with a familiar UX and DX as DeFi wallets (e.g. Metamask).\nAny dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets. In that way, we offer the dApp a way to track and manage a user's CEX assets while staying non-custodial and keeping the same UX as any DeFi browser wallet.\n\nTo integrate cede.store into a dApp, similar to how a DeFi wallet functions, the dApp interacts with a provider object (e.g., `window.ethereum` for EVM wallets or `window.cede` for cede.store). The dApp can execute various methods, such as retrieving balances or initiating a withdrawal from the exchange to the blockchain.\n\nIf a project prefers not to interact directly with this API, they can utilize our widget, which facilitates the transfer of funds from a CEX to the user\u2019s address. For a list of all our partners, visit https://cede.store/partners.\n\n\n- Cede SDK:\nFor more advanced integrations and white-label needs, builders can opt to use our Cede SDK. This solution offers deeper customization of CEX connectivity, allowing developers to store CEX API keys wherever they see fit, ensure mobile compatibility, and bypass the need for the cede.store browser extension.\nCurrently, Cede SDK is a CEX connectivity SDK helping custody providers and custodians fast-forward their CEX integrations for asset management.\u00a0\nBasically: Fireblocks\u2019 CEX connectivity as a service.\n\nStellar Integration & Soroban:\u00a0As part of our broader strategy, Cede Labs is working to integrate the Stellar blockchain into its API and SDK. This will allow Stellar-based dApps to access liquidity from centralized exchanges, greatly expanding Stellar\u2019s utility. Soroban, Stellar\u2019s smart contract engine, will be instrumental in this integration, particularly through the introduction of an \"Instant Protocol Deposit\" feature. This feature will enable users to seamlessly transfer assets from CEXs directly into Stellar-based protocols, such as DeFi applications, without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging Soroban, we ensure that this functionality is permissionless and optimized for security and scalability, helping Stellar attract significant liquidity and making it a competitive player in the DeFi space.\n\nWhy We Chose Stellar\nWe selected Stellar\u2019s blockchain infrastructure for three primary reasons:\n1. Alignment with Our Vision for Institutional-Grade Liquidity Solutions: Stellar provides the scalability, low transaction fees, and cross-border functionality essential for institutions managing large volumes of digital assets. With Stellar\u2019s infrastructure, we can offer our clients seamless connectivity to manage CEX liquidity more efficiently, allowing them to bridge the gap between centralized exchanges and decentralized applications.\n2. Focus on Cross-Border Payments and Financial Inclusion: Stellar\u2019s well-established reputation as a leader in cross-border payments perfectly aligns with our goal to facilitate liquidity management across global markets. For institutional players looking to streamline CEX operations and manage assets across borders, Cede.store and Cede SDK offer the ideal tools to integrate into the Stellar ecosystem.\n3. Strong connections with the institutional space and with Ripple: the current niche where Cede Labs is focusing at the moment with Cede SDK product is the custody solutions space. Knowing that Stellar is very close to Ripple, one of the leaders in the institutional custody space with its product Ripple Custody, is a strong argument that led us to choose Stellar.\u00a0\n\nThis not only empowers financial institutions but also accelerates the integration of Stellar\u2019s ecosystem into mainstream financial operations. As we continue to refine our offerings, Cede Labs is committed to driving the adoption of Stellar by providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for institutional participation in the blockchain ecosystem.",
