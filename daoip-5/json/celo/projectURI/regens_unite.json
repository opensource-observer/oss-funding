    "description": "We launched the Regens Unite Berlin second annual event with a Celo Education Zone in September 2023. The Education Zone served as a dedicated space during the event for attendees to learn more about Celo, going through onboarding, and meet members of the community.\n\n- 200 attendees at Regens Unite Berlin 2023\n- Celo Education Zone: https://x.com/regensunite/status/1710298471930974498\n- Recap thread: https://twitter.com/regensunite/status/1710298452301590902\n\nOn March 27th we gathered over 30 people in a 2-hour interactive call to map out projects and experiments that contribute to regenerating our economies. The call was initiated by the Citizen Wallet, and facilitated by the facilitators of Regens Unite. The goal of the project was to bring more visibilities to the wide variety of projects out there, and to help people find out how they can contribute and join. The full report is linked and a follow up call is planned May 27th.\n\n- Full report of call: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FpZxehzQDrcV0_7Myv2QLy8JJtW3OzQ0sfkmXfO0VQE/edit#heading=h.csp2wgnshcpn\n\nRecently at our event in Amsterdam in April 2024, we experimented with the Regen Hour Token on Celo network.\n\n- Tweet: https://twitter.com/regensunite/status/1781307165531107419",
